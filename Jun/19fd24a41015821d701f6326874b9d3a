LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- America is steeped in violence and the roots of that violence go deep, The Guardian has said. There have already been 27 school shootings nationwide and a total of 213 mass shootings in the United States since this year, the newspaper said in a report on Wednesday. That's about three mass shootings for every two days. "A country that develops and relies on the overwhelming size and severity of its penal system is also a country beholden to its own violence," said the article, noting that the United States continues to incarcerate far more people than any other country, with about 664 out of every 100,000 people in prison. While there are times when Americans talk about forging peace in the country, the truth of the matter is that it makes a lot of war: military conflicts make up perhaps 93 percent of its history, the article said. "America's obsession with guns and violence reflects its own genocidal and racist past," it said, adding that "in fact, American violence has its roots in its own settler-colonial origins."  ■
