CANBERRA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Health experts who led Australia's response to the coronavirus pandemic have been recognized on the annual Queen's Birthday honors list. Brendan Murphy, the Department of Health secretary who was the Chief Medical Officer at the start of the pandemic, was one of 92 people who were honored on Monday for their work during the pandemic. Murphy and Jeannette Young, Queensland's former Chief Health Officer, were among eight Australians who were appointed in the General Division of the Order of Australia (AC) - the highest honor awarded on the Queen's Birthday public holiday. He described the honor as "very humbling" and thanked the "brilliant and talented" people he worked with. "In each of those roles I've been working with brilliant, dedicated people who have been focused on making a difference for the health of the nation," Murphy said. Former tennis world No. 1 Ash Barty, who stunned the world in March by retiring at 26, was recognized for "distinguished service to tennis at the elite level and to youth development programs." Cricket great Shane Warne, who died in March aged 52, was honored posthumously. "Recipients share some common traits - including selflessness, excellence and a commitment to service," Governor-General David Hurley said. "They're from different backgrounds, their stories are each unique, and each has served in different ways. This diversity is a strength and each has impacted their community and made it better." On Monday morning, Australia reported more than 12,000 new COVID-19 cases and seven deaths.  ■
