KAMPALA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Ministry of Health on Friday announced that children are to be vaccinated against COVID-19 only with the consent of their parents, guardians or caretakers. "This will be upheld during the vaccination of children," the ministry said in a statement. The statement comes when public attention was drawn to several media posts that children in Uganda would be inoculated without parents' consent. The plan was announced by the ministry in April to start vaccinating children aged 12-17 when the school term begins on May 9 and is aimed at boosting the immunity of the children against the disease.  ■
