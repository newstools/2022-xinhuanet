WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- One teenager died and three adults were injured after a shooting in Washington, D.C. on Sunday night. The shooting occurred in "the area of 14th and U Street, NW" -- a popular area filled with stores, restaurants and bars, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee told reporters that a 15-year-old was killed while three adults -- two civilians and one police officer -- were wounded but are expected to survive. D.C. Police Union tweeted that the officer who was shot "has been transported to the hospital and is in stable condition." A free music festival marking Juneteenth was being held in that area when the shooting broke out and caused panic among the crowd. Contee said the event was unpermitted. The incident came a day after shots were fired inside a large shopping mall in Virginia, near Washington, D.C. No one appeared to have been shot but three people were taken to the hospital for injuries suffered while they were fleeing from inside, according to police. More than 20,000 people have died due to gun violence across the United States so far this year, according to the latest data from Gun Violence Archive.  ■
