ROME, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Italy is on the verge of removing its final coronavirus health restrictions, though masks may still be mandatory on public transportation and in hospitals, a top health official said Tuesday. The comment from Italian Health Undersecretary Andrea Costa came amid a gradual increase in COVID-19 infection rates, though other indicators -- hospitalization rates, the number of patients in intensive-care units, and coronavirus-related deaths -- remain relatively low. On Friday, Italy's High Institute of Health reported that during the one-week period ending the day before, the country's COVID-19 infection rate was 222 per 100,000 residents, an increase from 207 per 100,000 residents reported the previous week. The rate had been in decline since April. In an interview on Radio Capitale, Costa was asked to comment on the possible lifting of the mask mandate after the June 15 expiration of the current rules. Costa said the mask mandate will be lifted as scheduled in cinemas, theaters, and during indoor sporting events. However, masks are likely to remain mandatory on public transportation and in hospitals until September. The mask mandate will likely be extended "for the most crowded places and those where a little more prudence is needed," Costa said. The remarks were confirmed by Ministry of Health officials. Italy was the first European country hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with peaks of more than 200,000 new coronavirus cases per day recorded as recently as January. In recent weeks, daily infections have mostly been below 25,000. On Tuesday, the country reported nearly 40,000 new cases, the highest level in nearly a month.  ■
