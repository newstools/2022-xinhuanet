ULAN BATOR, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia on Monday launched a nationwide campaign to raise public awareness of the causes and effects of road accidents. Activities, including a series of briefings and presentations on road safety, randomly checking vehicles on rural roads and placing banners and posters on preventing road accidents will be held, the National Police Agency, one of the co-organizers of the three-month-long campaign titled "You will reach your destination even though you travel slowly," said in a statement. Road accidents in Mongolia increase in summer and tourist seasons because the number of people traveling to the countryside dramatically increases, the police agency said, urging drivers to comply with traffic rules to protect themselves and their loved ones. Overspeeding, drunk, reckless and fatigue driving, and unpermitted overtaking are said to be the common causes of road accidents in the country. In the first five months this year, 7,408 road accidents across the country killed 195 people and seriously injured 1,087 others, according to the police.  ■
