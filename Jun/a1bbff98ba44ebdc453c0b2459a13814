PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Health Brigitte Bourguignon has recommended wearing a face mask in public transport, local media reported on Monday. "I ask the French to put back the mask in transport," she told French radio RTL. The minister also recommended mask use in closed and crowded areas. "You only have to see a crowded train station or train to know that first. You have to protect yourself and protect others," said Bourguignon. She said the authorities are considering new measures in light of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections in the country. The mandatory wearing of masks in public transport was lifted on May 16 in France. The country's Public Health Agency reported 17,601 new COVID-19 cases nationwide on Monday, an increase of 52.2 percent in seven days.  ■
