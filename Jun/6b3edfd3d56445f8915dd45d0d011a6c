KABUL, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Afghan Minister for Education Ghulam Farooq Wardak returned to Afghanistan on Wednesday, the state-run Bakhtar news agency reported. "It is good to be back home," the news agency quoted Wardak as saying. After landing at Kabul's airport, where he was received by officials from the Taliban-run administration, Wardak also called upon Afghans living outside the country to return home and serve the nation. Wardak, according to the news agency, is among thousands of Afghans who left the country in the wake of U.S. military defeat and the Taliban's takeover of the country in August last year. The Taliban-run administration has constituted the "Commission for Return and Communication with Afghan personalities" to encourage those who left the country to come back. Earlier, a number of personalities including deputy to the Ministry of Transport and a spokesman for the defense ministry in the former administration also returned to Afghanistan.  ■
