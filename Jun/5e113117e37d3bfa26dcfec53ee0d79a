FRANKFURT, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Croatia has fulfilled the necessary conditions and is ready to adopt the euro on Jan. 1, 2023, the European Commission (EC) has said in a conclusion in its assessment report, which will pave the way for Croatia to become the 20th member of the euro area. In the 2022 Convergence Report released on Wednesday, the EC said Croatia fulfills the four nominal convergence criteria and its legislation is fully compatible with the requirements, setting the stage for the Council of the European Union (EU) to make its final decision on Croatia's euro adoption in the first half of July. According to the report, Croatia was found to be the only one among a total of seven countries including Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden to have met all the four criteria, namely price stability, public finances, exchange rate and long-term interest rate. Commenting on the report, EC President Ursula von der Leyen said: "Today, Croatia has made a significant step towards adopting the euro ... This will make Croatia's economy stronger, bringing benefits to its citizens, businesses and society at large. Croatia's adoption of the euro will also make the euro stronger." The EC's Convergence Report forms the basis for the Council of the EU's decision on whether a member state fulfills the conditions for joining the euro area. Its report is separate to, but published in parallel with, the Convergence Report of the European Central Bank.   ■
