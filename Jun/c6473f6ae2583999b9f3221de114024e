CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The virulent combination of white supremacy and easy access to firearms have led to rapidly increasing hate crimes in the United States, a political analyst has said. Speaking to Xinhua, Ezzat Saad, director of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, said, "the rise of hard-line right-wing ideology and hate speeches provides a suitable incubator for feeding violence and crimes in American society," adding that the country's weak gun-control policies have given an easy pass for violent racists to get weapons. Saad, who once served as an assistant foreign minister of Egypt, argued that white supremacy is one reason behind surging violence in the United States, noting that at least two of the recent mass shootings in America were driven by the delusion of white people's control over other ethnic groups. "I expect gun violence will continue to escalate in the United States because all the speeches (made by politicians) only serve the elections and rip the country into antagonistic factions," he said. Saad also blamed U.S. legislative bodies for aggravating mass shootings, saying lawmakers serve as mouthpieces for powerful interest groups, which have earned considerable profits from gun sales. For instance, Saad said there are lawmakers who, instead of calling for stricter laws to curb the arms trade inside the country, suggest more investment in psychological therapy, touting it as a way to decrease mass shootings. He added that such a move misses the target by miles because most shooters in the United States do not have any psychological problems. Saad said Washington's disdain for human rights at home extends abroad. He cited numerous U.S. unilateral military operations outside its territories over the decades that caused countless civilian casualties, with no respect for other countries' legitimate rights and interests.  ■
