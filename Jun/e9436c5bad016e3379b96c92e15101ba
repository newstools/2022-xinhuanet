TUNIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian judges decided on Saturday to extend their strike for a third week in protest of the president's decision to dismiss 57 judges. "The judges also decided to organize a 'day of anger' in front of the public next week to clarify the reasons for maintaining the strike for three weeks in a row," President of the Tunisian Young Judges' Association Mourad Messaoudi told the Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP). On June 1, Tunisian President Kais Saied issued a presidential decree to dismiss 57 judges over corruption and covering up terrorist cases. In protest, the Tunisian Magistrates' Association (AMT) launched a one-week strike on June 6. During the strike, only burial permits and extremely urgent terrorism cases will continue to be processed.  ■
