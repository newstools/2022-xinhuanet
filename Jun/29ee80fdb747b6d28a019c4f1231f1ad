SYDNEY, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Sail Grand Prix (SailGP) will return to the iconic Sydney Harbour in February next year as the ninth event in the third season calendar. The Grand Prix announced on Friday that the event in Sydney is scheduled from February 18 to 19, 2023, with the third season starting in Bermuda in May this year. Ten teams will compete in the third season, including new franchises Canada and Switzerland and returning nations Australia, Denmark, France, Britain, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the United States. The event will also feature a range of on-water and on-land fan experiences, providing fans with a front-row seat to witness advanced catamarans ripping through the harbor at breathtaking speeds of up to 100 kilometers per hour (km/h). Sydney has also secured the right to host the racing for three consecutive seasons. The race attracted an estimated 20,000 people to Sydney Harbour in December 2021, and overall, the Grand Prix reached 88.5 million people worldwide. "As one of only eleven iconic locations in the global SailGP league, the Australia Sail Grand Prix will provide a significant boost to the state's visitor economy by showcasing our spectacular Harbour city to the world," said Stuart Ayres, NSW Minister for Tourism and Sport. After Sydney, Sail GP will head to New Zealand in March, followed by the United States which will host the Grand Final.  ■
