HANOI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Some localities in southern Vietnam have witnessed an increasing number of dengue fever cases in the past few weeks, local media reported on Tuesday. Ho Chi Minh City remained the hotspot with more than 10,000 cases and seven deaths so far this year, while An Giang province has reported more than 1,300 dengue fever outbreaks with a total of 3,916 cases, nearly a four-fold increase from the same period last year, Vietnam News Agency reported. The provincial health department of An Giang said the upward trend was attributed to the rainy season, noting that the supply of fluid to treat dengue shock syndrome is insufficient. Elsewhere, Soc Trang province has reported 128 outbreaks with more than 600 cases since early 2022, up 130 percent and 85 percent year on year respectively. Among them, one died and 23 were severe cases, according to the news agency. Tien Giang province has recorded over 800 cases with two deaths from the disease while Dong Thap province had nearly 1,400 cases with one death, the news agency reported. Amid the rising number of cases, localities in the southern region have strengthened their preventive measures, including wiping out mosquitoes in high-risk places, the news agency reported. In the first five months of this year, Vietnam reported 25,861 cases of dengue fever, including 13 deaths, according to the country's General Statistics Office.  ■
