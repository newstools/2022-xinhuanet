KABUL, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban-run caretaker administration has said Washington's report on deteriorating religious freedom in Afghanistan was utterly incorrect. "The religious and civil rights of all minorities in Afghanistan are protected. In this regard, the State Department's report is incomplete and based on false information. All our Sunnis, Shiites, Sikhs and Hindus practice their religion freely. We reject the State Dept. report," the administration's chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter on Sunday. In its annual report released recently, the U.S. State Department accused Afghanistan's new rulers of violating human rights, asserting that situation for religious freedom in Afghanistan has been deteriorating since the Taliban's takeover of the country in August last year, according to media reports.  ■
