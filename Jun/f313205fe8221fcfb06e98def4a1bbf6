Nearly 30 houses were evacuated in the Gokcebey district of Zonguldak province, and over 100 people were moved to the safe zone while homes and businesses were flooded. There were no casualties or missing people, said Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. Authorities asked citizens to stay away from dangerous areas where might be hit by floods due to the possibility of increased precipitation. Heavy rain is expected to end by late Wednesday. In August last year, 82 people were killed by heavy floods in the Black Sea region. ■  Photo taken on June 28, 2022 shows floods after heavy rains in Kastamonu, Turkey.
