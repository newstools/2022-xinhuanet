NEW YORK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The West, led by the United States, is giving the conflict in Ukraine a momentum that may be impossible to stop, said a recent opinion on The New York Times. "The United States has helped turn this tragic, local and ambiguous conflict into a potential world conflagration," said contributing writer Christopher Caldwell in the article "The War in Ukraine May Be Impossible to Stop. And the U.S. Deserves Much of the Blame." The situation on the battlefield in Ukraine has evolved to an awkward stage, the author said, warning that "if the war does not end soon, its dangers will increase." "Negotiations need to begin in the next two months, before it creates upheavals and tensions that will not be easily overcome," Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. secretary of state, was quoted in the article. Kissinger warned that "pursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine but a new war against Russia itself."  ■
