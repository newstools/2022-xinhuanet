NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Olympians Elizabeth Andiego and Nick Okoth will spearhead Kenya's medal hunt in boxing at the forthcoming Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games next month, the coach said on Wednesday. Boxing coach Benjamin Musa said flyweight Okoth took bronze at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India, and will once again captain the Kenyan boxing team to Birmingham with the country seeking to win the first gold at the event since 1994. Musa is confident that both male and female boxers in the team have an equal chance to scale the podium. "If you look at their history in performance, they have not been at this improved level, and after the women's World Championships last month, they have improved a lot," Musa told journalists in Nairobi. The team of four boxers has been in camp for two weeks now and still has six more weeks of training before the start of the Birmingham games on July 28. "We are quite a number of boxers in camp and the coach is looking at everyone. There is no hiding place. He has no pressure, the coach is very active, he is talking to everyone and looking at everyone," Okoth said. Andiego who is the other experienced boxer in the squad having taken part in the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games in Scotland is optimistic of a better performance in 2022. "I missed the 2018 edition because of an accident that left me with broken legs. I'm fully recovered and looking forward to the competition. I boxed at the Olympics, and what is remaining now is to get a medal," she added. Their training base in Nairobi has been fitted with a boxing ring with the boxers receiving all the equipment they need for training. Kenya has won 48 Commonwealth medals in boxing, among them 13 gold to rank the sport second only to athletics.  ■
