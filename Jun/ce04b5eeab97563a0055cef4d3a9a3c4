ANKARA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Armenia will hold the fourth round of talks on normalizing bilateral relations in the Austrian capital of Vienna on Friday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday. Turkey sends former diplomat Serdar Kilic to the talks, while Armenia designates Vice President of its National Assembly Ruben Rubinyan as a special envoy. Turkey and Armenia held their first round of normalization talks in Moscow in January, followed by two rounds in Vienna in February and May. In February, the two neighbors resumed charter flights between Istanbul and the Armenian capital city of Yerevan. Foreign ministers of the two countries met on March 12 in the Turkish southwestern resort city of Antalya to reaffirm their willingness to continue the normalization process. Apart from fully restoring the diplomatic ties, the process also aims to open borders between the two neighbors and launch joint economic, trade, and transportation projects. Relations between the two countries were severed in 1993 during the first war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh when Turkey closed the border with Armenia in support of Azerbaijan.  ■
