Wei said that China-Singapore relations have developed continuously under the strategic guidance of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, which have played a leading and exemplary role in the Asia-Pacific region. Faced with changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, he said, China and Singapore should continue to deepen strategic mutual trust, expand the convergence of interests, and support each other on issues concerning their core interests and major concern, so as to inject positive energy into safeguarding regional peace and stability. Wei said that the two militaries have enjoyed a stable development of relations over recent years, and they should continue to enhance high-level exchanges and practical cooperation, so as to constantly push forward the ties between the two militaries.
