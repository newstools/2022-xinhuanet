KHARTOUM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese army on Tuesday denied press reports that the army captured Ethiopian soldiers on the Sudan-Ethiopia border amid an escalating crisis between the two countries. "News reports concerning the activities of the forces and the capture of Ethiopian soldiers in the Fashaga region were circulating. The news is incorrect and misleading," the office of the Sudanese army spokesman said in a statement. "The Sudanese Armed Forces reaffirm that it has not issued any statements regarding the situation on Sudan's eastern border," the statement said. On Sunday, the Sudanese Armed Forces said the Ethiopian army "executed" seven Sudanese soldiers and a citizen who were held captive, which Ethiopia denied. On Monday, Sudan decided to file a formal complaint to the United Nations Security Council against Ethiopia, while the Sudanese foreign ministry decided to immediately recall its ambassador to Ethiopia for consultations and to summon the Ethiopian ambassador in Khartoum to inform him of Sudan's condemnation. Since September 2020, the Sudan-Ethiopia border has been witnessing rising tensions and deadly skirmishes between the two sides.  ■
