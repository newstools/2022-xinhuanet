ULAN BATOR, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia will improve social protection for children with disabilities, Ayush Ariunzaya, the country's minister of labor and social protection, said Wednesday. A note outlining 26 measures to be taken on children with disabilities was issued during a regular government meeting. Instructions were given to cabinet members and governors of the capital city and all 21 provinces of the country, Ariunzaya told a press conference. In particular, the Mongolian government is expected to pay for treating children with cerebral palsy. In addition, the government will pay for the social insurance contributions of legal guardians of children under 18 and provide children with disabilities with equal opportunities to study in kindergartens and general education schools. Currently, Mongolia faces a shortage of much-needed staff to work with disabled people, such as physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech pathologists and sign language interpreters. According to the minister, the government will offer support to those who want to study such professions. According to official statistics, Mongolia, with a population of around 3.4 million, is home to roughly 130,000 people with disabilities, and over 10 percent of them are children.  ■
