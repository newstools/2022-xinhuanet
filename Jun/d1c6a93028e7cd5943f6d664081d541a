TUNIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Kais Saied issued a presidential decree late Wednesday to dismiss 57 judges over corruption and covering up terrorist cases. The presidential decree was published in the Journal of the Republic of Tunisia, an official biweekly gazette. Saied presided over a council of ministers meeting earlier in the day, vowing to move forward with "the purification of the judiciary." The president also pledged to publish the names of judges who "disrupted investigations into a total of 6,268 terrorism files and perpetrated financial and moral corruption." On Feb. 6, Saied decided to dissolve the country's Superior Council of the Judiciary amid suspected corruption by many local magistrates. He signed a presidential decree a week later to form a more temporary council to replace the dissolved one.  ■
