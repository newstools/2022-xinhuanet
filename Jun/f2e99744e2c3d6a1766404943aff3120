NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed and five others sustained injuries on Friday following a grisly road accident along a busy road in Narok County, southwest of Nairobi. Narok North Divisional Police Commander Alphonce Shiundu said the accident along the Bomet-Narok road involved a minibus locally known as matatu which was traveling to the capital, Nairobi and a truck heading to Bomet, a town in Rift Valley. Shiundu said the truck driver lost control of the vehicle after one of its right front tyres burst leading to a head-on collision with the oncoming matatu. "As a result of the accident, the matatu was extensively damaged," Shiundu said on the phone. The police commander said five people died on the spot while two succumbed to injuries while undergoing treatment at a local hospital. He said five of the survivors are receiving treatment in hospital after sustaining injuries, noting that the majority of the injured suffered head and hand injuries. According to the police, fatal accidents are common in Kenya due to reckless driving, dangerous overtaking, drunk driving, drunk walking, drunk riding, and failure to use helmets.  ■
