NEW YORK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Americans' search interest in firearms surged in nearly every congressional district after mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, news portal Axios reported this week. The report said such increased search interest shown by Google Trends data reflects Americans' intense concerns around gun violence and school safety after the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, which left 19 children and two teachers dead in May. According to the recent report, "firearms" was the second or third most searched topic in 409 of 435 districts during the week when the mass shooting happened. The latest data from the Gun Violence Archive indicate that there have already been more than 250 mass shootings in the United States this year.  ■
