HANOI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A webinar on Asia's renewable energy was held in Vietnam on Wednesday, highlighting the urgency to unleash clean energy potential in the region. Officials and industry experts at the webinar titled "Asia: Renewable Energy Continent" agreed that more needs to be done to accelerate the transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy in Asia. Asia is the continent with the highest level of energy consumption in the world with tremendous potential in renewable energy, said Tang The Cuong, director-general of the Department of Climate Change under Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. The Vietnamese official suggests countries promote cooperation in removing barriers to drive collaboration in scientific research, development and technology transfer, while investing more in power transmission, ecosystem restoration, circular economy, and carbon capture and storage technology, among others. Frank Phuan, CEO of Singapore-based SUNSEAP Group Pte company, said there are many opportunities looking at large-scale hybrid solar projects. He emphasized the development of floating solar in hydro dams as well as the implementation of solar-integrated agriculture. Asia accounts for more than half of global energy consumption, with 85 percent of it coming from fossil fuels, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The online conference was organized by the Vietnam News daily, in collaboration with India's The Statesman, and South Korea's The Korea Herald, who are members of the Asia News Network.  ■
