NEW YORK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks rebounded on Tuesday as the energy sector led the broad market higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 641.47 points, or 2.15 percent, to 30,530.25. The S&P 500 added 89.95 points, or 2.45 percent, to 3,764.79. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased 270.95 points, or 2.51 percent, to 11,069.30. All the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with energy and consumer discretionary up 5.14 percent and 2.82 percent, respectively, leading the gains. The rally followed a dreadful week on Wall Street as investors grew fearful that drastic rate hikes by the Federal Reserve may trigger a recession. Last week, the Fed raised interest rates by 75 basis points, the largest hike since 1994, as it races to fight inflation that is running at a multi-decade high. Meanwhile, it left the door open for a similar increase at its next meeting in July. For the trading week ending Friday, the S&P 500 shed 5.8 percent, booking its worst week since March 2020, while the Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq each fell 4.8 percent. U.S. financial markets were closed Monday for the Juneteenth holiday.  ■
