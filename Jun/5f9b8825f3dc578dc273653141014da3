BAMAKO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Malian transitional president Assimi Goita signed on Monday a decree to extend the political transition in Mali for 24 months, starting from March 26, 2022. This decision came two days after the 6th Extraordinary Session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) held in Accra, Ghana. West African leaders failed to agree on the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Mali. They also decided to re-examine the situation in Mali on July 3, while recommending continuing the dialogue to reach an agreement to ensure "a gradual lifting of sanctions" as "the criteria for the transition are achieved." After the coup of Aug. 18, 2020, an 18-month political transition was launched in Mali on Sept. 15, 2020. Since then, the transitional authorities have been negotiating an extension of the deadline with the ECOWAS. The Malian transitional government was required to restore constitutional order since they toppled the government in 2020. It failed to fulfill a promise to hold elections in February this year, prompting the comprehensive sanctions from the ECOWAS. In April, Malian transitional Prime Minister Choguel Kokalla Maiga announced the start of a 24-month transition process of free and transparent presidential elections in the country.  ■
