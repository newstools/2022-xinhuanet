TASHKENT, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan has made the first safe cargo transit from Pakistani port via Afghanistan in a week-long route, Uzbekistan's Transport Ministry said Friday. "Uzbek drivers, who traveled 2,760 kilometers on the route Tashkent - Termez - Mazar-e-Sharif - Kabul - Peshawar - Karachi, delivered cargo (frozen meat) from the port of Karachi to Tashkent," it said. Tripartite efforts have enabled the delivery of goods along this transport corridor through the territories of Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, in the shortest possible time and safely, according to the ministry. Landlocked Uzbekistan has been promoting transit transportation projects through the war-torn Afghan territory since the Taliban came back to power. Another important project is the 600-km Mazar-i-Sharif-Kabul-Peshawar railway project that will open Pakistani seaports to the Central Asian and Eurasian railway systems, significantly increasing cargo flows if implemented.  ■
