MOSCOW, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday denounced the "unprecedented decisions" by countries surrounding Serbia to close their national airspace for his flight to Belgrade. "A country's freedom of choosing partners, a principle upheld by the West, has been trampled on by the West itself. Serbia, from the point of view of the West, should not have such freedom," Lavrov said at an online press conference. Lavrov said the incident was an attempt to undermine Serbia's relations with Russia and restrict its foreign policy. During his daily briefing, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov slammed the "hostile actions" toward high-level Russian representatives and stressed that interactions between Russia and friendly countries like Serbia would continue. Lavrov was planning to visit Belgrade from Monday to Tuesday. His plane was denied entry into the airspace of the countries surrounding Serbia, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Sunday night.  ■
