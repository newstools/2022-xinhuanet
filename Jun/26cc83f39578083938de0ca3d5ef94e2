CHICAGO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador manager Gustavo Alfaro said Saturday that his team expects to face a well-drilled and skillful Mexican outfit when the sides meet here in an international friendly. Sunday's match at Chicago's Soldier field comes three days after Ecuador overcame Nigeria 1-0 in New Jersey. Mexico, meanwhile, will be attempting to rebound from a 3-0 defeat to Uruguay in Phoenix on Thursday. "Tomorrow's match will give us a very good evaluation of where we stand because Mexico are going to push us in different ways," Alfaro told a news conference. "Maybe Mexico don't have the fast transitions and speed of an African team, but they do have the technique and associative capacity that the best sides in the world have." Alfaro said he would make several changes to his starting lineup for Sunday's match following the high-intensity duel with Nigeria. Ecuador will complete their triple-header of friendlies against Cape Verde on June 11 while Mexico will confront Suriname on the same day.  ■
