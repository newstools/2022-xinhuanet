NAIROBI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Ministry of Health said Tuesday it has intensified COVID-19 vaccinations and is re-enforcing restrictions that include wearing of masks in public places as infections rise. Kenya has in the last four days recorded more than 400 cases, an average of 100 a day, as cases increase from less than 10 daily in the last six months. In response to the rising infections, Mutahi Kagwe, the cabinet secretary of  Ministry of Health, said the ministry has intensified vaccinations, giving the jabs to 10,670 people on Monday, an increase from an average of 4,000 daily in previous months when infections were lower. The new vaccinations push the number of those vaccinated to 18.2 million as the government works to achieve its target of vaccinating 27 million people by the end of June. To curb rising infections, Kenya, which will celebrate Independence Day on Wednesday, said no one will be allowed into the event in the capital Nairobi without face masks. The government had allowed citizens to attend such events without restrictions, having lifted mask wearing in public in March as infections declined. "Those Kenyans intending to attend the celebrations at Uhuru Gardens in Nairobi must have their masks on to be safe, " said Kangethe Thuku, Nairobi regional commissioner.  ■
