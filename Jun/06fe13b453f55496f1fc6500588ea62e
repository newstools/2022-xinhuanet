KABUL, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban-run caretaker administration has approved a six-month tentative plan that would create a standard land transport system generating up to 30 billion afghani (340 million U.S. dollars) annually, said the Economic Commission in a statement on Tuesday. In its weekly meeting on Monday, the commission decided to solve land transportation problems and approved a pilot project for the Transport Regulation Commission, which is applicable for six months, the statement said. "With implementation of the six-month pilot project, about 30 billion afghani in revenue will be collected annually to add to the state treasury," the statement added, without giving further details. The war-torn country has suffered from a lack of modern transport systems such as asphalted highways and railways to alleviate poverty and rebuild its economy.  ■
