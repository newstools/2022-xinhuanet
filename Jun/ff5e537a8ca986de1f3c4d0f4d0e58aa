ZAGREB, June 6 (Xinhua) -- As of Wednesday, the Croatian government will once more cut excise duties on oil products and introduce a limit on retail margins to mitigate the rising fuel prices. "(Earlier,) we reduced the excise tax by 40 lipa (0.06 U.S. dollars), (and) now we are reducing it by an additional 40 lipa per liter of motor gasoline," Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said on Monday. For diesel fuel, the corresponding figures are 20 lipa each (0.03 U.S. dollars), he said. Therefore, from Wednesday, drivers are expected to pay around 115 kuna (16.40 U.S. dollars) less for a 50-liter tank of petrol, and 71 kuna (10.13 U.S. dollars) less for a tank of diesel. Moreover, Plenkovic said that the government will also restrict the margin of producers and distributors by an additional 10 lipa (0.01 US dollars). "As long the circumstances are more than unusual, we will use the available mechanisms and intervene for the benefit of Croatian citizens," Plenkovic said. The new measures are expected to stay in place for one month. Other price control measures adopted by the government on March 7, will expire in the coming days.  ■
