KABUL, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ten commuters were killed and two more sustained injuries as a mini-bus turned turtle in the central Daykundi province, the state-run Bakhtar news agency reported Friday. The deadly traffic accident, according to the news agency, took place on a congested road in the mountainous Miramor district on Thursday afternoon, leaving 10 dead and two more commuters injured. Bakhtar also added the ill-fated vehicle was heading to the national capital Kabul. The dead included two women. Although there are no official statistics, reckless driving and congested roads are often blamed for the road accidents in war-ravaged Afghanistan.  ■
