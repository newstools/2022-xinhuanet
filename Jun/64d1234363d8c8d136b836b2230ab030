SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, June 2 (Xinhua) -- At least three troopers belonging to the Indian army were wounded Thursday in a blast inside a vehicle carrying them in the Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said. The blast occurred in Shopian district, about 52 km south of Srinagar, the summer capital of the Indian-controlled Kashmir. An Indian army spokesman based in Srinagar said the blast occurred when  the troopers were traveling to a site to carry out a search operation. "The blast is very likely to be from either an improvised explosive device (IED) or a grenade or a battery malfunctioning in the vehicle. Details are being ascertained," the spokesman said. One of the troopers was severely injured, and the conditions of the two others were stable, said the spokesman. Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan, is claimed by both in full. Since their independence from Britain, the two countries have fought three wars, two exclusively over Kashmir.  ■
