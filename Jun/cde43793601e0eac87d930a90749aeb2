BEIRUT, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The EU delegation to Lebanon on Monday announced the launch of a 6-million-euro project in Lebanon's southern town of Srebbine aimed at strengthening the Lebanese Armed Forces in deploying to the country's south to maintain security. The project comes in line with Lebanon's commitment to increase its presence in the south to gradually take over responsibility from UN Interim Force in Lebanon. To this end, Lebanon established and deployed a new infantry unit named Model Regiment in the UNIFIL area of operations. "This project reflects the commitment of the European Union to help build and reinforce the capabilities of Lebanese state institutions, including the Lebanese Armed Forces," Ambassador of the European Union to Lebanon Ralph Tarraf said at a ceremony.  ■
