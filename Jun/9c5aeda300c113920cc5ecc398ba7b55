SEOUL, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors sold South Korean stocks for five straight months in May amid rising concerns over inflation, financial watchdog data showed Monday. Foreigners dumped a net 1.61 trillion won (1.3 billion U.S. dollars) worth of local stocks in May, remaining net sellers in the domestic stock market since January, according to the Financial Supervisory Service. It was attributable to growing inflationary pressures that led the U.S. central bank to hike interest rates and absorb ample liquidity in the market. U.S. and Irish investors were net sellers in the local stock market, but investors from Switzerland and Norway bought domestic stocks last month. Foreign holdings of local stocks stood at 695.9 trillion won (540.7 billion dollars) at the end of May, accounting for 26.8 percent of the total market capitalization. Meanwhile, offshore investors purchased a net 6.46 trillion won (5 billion dollars) worth of local bonds in May. Given matured debts worth 5.09 trillion won (4 billion dollars), the foreign net investment in local bonds came to 1.37 trillion won (1 billion dollars). The foreign ownership of domestic bonds reached 225.8 trillion won (175.4 billion dollars) at the end of May.  ■
