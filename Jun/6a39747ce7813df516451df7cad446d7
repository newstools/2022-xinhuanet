BISSAU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The West African country Guinea-Bissau announced on Thursday evening new members of government, including 24 ministers and 12 secretaries of state, according to a presidential decree. The announcement came after Guinea-Bissau's President Umaro Sissoco Embalo dissolved the parliament on May 16 due to the existence of persistent and insurmountable differences between the National People's Assembly and other sovereign bodies, including the Court of Auditors. The new government will be led by Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam.  ■
