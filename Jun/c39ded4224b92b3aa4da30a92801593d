LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday won a no-confidence vote among Conservative lawmakers, saving his precarious premiership. Johnson won the support of 211 out of the 359 lawmakers, dozens more than the threshold of 180 votes, according to the result announced by Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative Party's parliamentary group, the 1922 Committee. "I can announce that the parliamentary party does have confidence in the prime minister," Brady said. Under the current rules, Johnson will not face another no-confidence vote for a year after winning Monday's vote. Johnson has been dogged for months by "partygate" scandals involving him and his staff at Downing Street during COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and 2021. He received a fine by the British police in April for attending one of the alcohol-fueled parties, making him the first sitting prime minister in British history to be penalized for breaking the law.  ■
