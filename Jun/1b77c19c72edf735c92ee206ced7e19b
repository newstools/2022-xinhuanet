NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Robust investments in green energy should inform the quest to achieve net-zero emission targets in Africa where communities and ecosystems are reeling from negative impacts of the climate crisis, senior policymakers said Thursday. Speaking at Africa's first Sustainable Energy Conference held in a hybrid format in Naivasha, a resort town located 90 kilometers northwest of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, the policymakers and experts said the continent's green energy transition hinged on innovative financing and friendly regulations. Monica Juma, Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for energy noted that Africa's vulnerability to climate change had worsened, adding that leveraging clean energy solutions could boost resilience, unleash new jobs. "For Africa to achieve carbon neutrality targets set by the Paris Agreement, the continent must invest in green energy and avert irreversible damage to ecosystems and livelihoods linked to temperature rise," said Juma. Convened by the Kenyan government in conjunction with industry and multilateral partners, the Africa's inaugural sustainable energy conference brought together policymakers, business leaders, financiers and experts to discuss novel ways to hasten the continent's green transition. Juma called for reconfiguring the multilateral climate finance regime to ensure African countries had greater access to funds and technologies that can be channeled towards renewable energy projects. Kevin Kariuki, the vice president for Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth at African Development Bank (AfDB) said the continent's net zero targets were within reach, subject to policy reforms and adequate investments in clean energy solutions. According to Kariuki, African countries should incentivize the private sector to invest in green energy in order to hasten low carbon growth besides improving health outcomes for local communities. Kariuki said that Pan African lenders had prioritized investments in off-grid solar solutions and mini-grids in order to expand energy access in rural areas, boost inclusive growth.  ■
