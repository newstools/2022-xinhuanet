ACCRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government has repatriated 1,320 Nigeriens who beg in the streets to their home country, said a statement issued by the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection. The repatriation, through the collaboration of the Ghana Immigration Service and the Embassy of Niger in Ghana, included 300 adult males, 400 adult females, and 620 children. "The returnees were found under bridges, traffic lights intersections, street pavements, and other places begging for alms or loitering on the streets of Accra," the statement said. The exercise, according to the government, is part of measures being taken to deal with the menace of streetism in the West African country. "Streetism is a social menace that has wreaked havoc on the nation's social and economic life. The country's 'street children' prevalence is extremely worrying. This literally put their lives at risk so long as they remain on the street," the statement said. The government further urged the general populace to support efforts underway to reduce child begging and streetism. The Ghanaian government also deported 202 African nationals who had been arrested for entering the country unlawfully through its eastern border with Togo last year.  ■
