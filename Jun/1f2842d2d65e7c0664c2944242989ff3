TRIPOLI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said Monday that 675 illegal migrants were returned to Libya after being rescued off the coast last week. From May 29 May to June 4, "675 migrants have been disembarked back on Libyan shores," IOM said in a statement. So far in 2022, a total of 7,742 illegal migrants have been rescued and returned to Libya, including 557 women and 300 minors, IOM added. Meanwhile, 143 illegal migrants died and 547 others went missing on the Central Mediterranean route, it said. In 2021, a total of 32,425 illegal migrants were rescued and returned to Libya, while 662 died and 891 others went missing off the Libyan coast on the Central Mediterranean route, IOM revealed. Libya has been suffering insecurity and chaos since the fall of the late leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, making the North African country a preferred point of departure for illegal migrants who want to cross the Mediterranean Sea to European shores.  ■
