TRIPOLI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Government of National Unity in Libya on Monday said it has allocated 1 billion Libyan dinars (about 210 million U.S. dollars) over the past two years to maintain the country's power plants. "All the power plants in the country need maintenance. Some plants were not maintained for over 15 years," Mohamed Hamuda, the government spokesman, told a press conference in the capital Tripoli after a cabinet meeting. Some new power plants have not been used yet for "security and technical reasons," he said. Libyans tend to suffer a 14-hour power cut on a daily basis, especially during the summer, amid years of armed conflict and instability in the North African country.  ■
