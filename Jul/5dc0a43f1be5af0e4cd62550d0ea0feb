DHAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Bangladesh's unprecedented floods has risen to over 100, the authorities said Sunday. According to a daily flood report of the Health Emergency Operation Center and Control Room, the floods have killed 102 people in 27 out of 64 flood-affected districts between May 17 and June 28. Most victims died from drowning, snake bites and lightnings in the flood-hit areas, showed the report. At least 7 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours as of Sunday morning. With roads washed away by the floods triggered by heavy seasonal rains and onrush of water from hills, the authorities have still been battling to deliver supplies in many northeastern and northern districts. Also, the floods have caused widespread damage to houses and crops across vast swathes of northern and northeastern regions. Bangladeshi State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Md Enamur Rahman earlier told reporters that both the government and private agencies have been working together in the greater Sylhet region worst hit by the floods.  ■
