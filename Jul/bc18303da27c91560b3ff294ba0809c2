UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- In a significant action in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the UN mission on Thursday closed its Kalemie offices in Tanganyika province, a UN spokesman said. "This is a major step forward in the progressive, phased, drawdown of the mission," said Stephane Dujarric, the chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. "The decision recognizes significant steps taken by Congolese authorities, with the support of the United Nations, to strengthen the presence and capacity of state institutions in the area." He said the mission and the UN country team continue to support the government in pursuing key reforms to preserve and consolidate progress. However, the spokesman contrasted the positive news from Kalemie on the western shore of Lake Tanganyika, just south of South Kivu province, with the continuing reports of fighting to the north. "The situation in the eastern part of the country remains tense as the M23 armed group have continued to target the Congolese army, as well as the UN's own position in North Kivu province," he said. "This morning (Thursday), three rockets were fired towards the mission's position in Kabindi, which is about 12 km southeast of Rutshuru. Two of the rockets landed close to our peacekeepers' position." There were no reports of casualties. In its latest situation report, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that humanitarians are concerned about continued population movements because of the ongoing fighting in Rutshuru territory. As of Monday, more than 160,000 people have been displaced in Rutshuru and Nyiragongo territories since the violence began in March.  ■
