LAMU, Kenya, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan soldiers on Friday killed ten al-Shabab terrorists and recovered a grenade and several weapons during a security operation conducted within the vast Boni forest in the coastal Lamu region. Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) said the troops conducted an operation along Sanira-Kolbio areas within the expansive Boni forest where they killed newly graduated al-Shabab militants while others escaped with multiple injuries. "One rocket propelled grenade launcher, seven assault weapons, assorted ammunition as well as personal effects were recovered during the operation. The militia are part of the Jeysh Ayman team led by Maalim Ayman who had planned to carry out attacks within the Lamu Port South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPPSET) corridor," the KDF said in the statement. The KDF said its troops will intensify operations along the Kenya-Somalia border, along with other security agencies and support from local residents to pacify the area in a bid to get rid of al-Shabab terrorists. Security officials say al-Shabab have changed tactics and have resorted to using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to carry out attacks in parts of coastal and northeast regions. The officials said the militants have been using Boni forest as their hideout and also launch attacks in the region. The explosive devices strategically planted along the roads near Kenya-Somalia border are slowing down security operations to flush out militants hiding in the vast Boni forest which is near the Somali border.  ■
