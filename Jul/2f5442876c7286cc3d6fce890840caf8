NAIROBI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's export earnings in the first quarter amounted to 208.8 billion shillings (about 1.77 billion U.S. dollars), representing a growth of 8.7 percent compared to the same period in 2021, the government statistics agency said on Friday. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) said that Africa continued to be the leading export destination, accounting for 39.8 percent of the total export earnings. "This improvement was partly due to a significant increase in exports to Tanzania which almost doubled," KNBS said in a statement issued in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. According to the statistics bureau, the total exports to Rwanda and Ethiopia also expanded in the first quarter compared to a similar period last year. The bureau noted that total exports to Uganda declined in the review period, largely as a result of a decline in exports of crude palm oil and cement clinkers. KNBS revealed that the value of exports to the European Union slightly improved, boosted by an increase in domestic exports of coffee to Belgium.  ■
