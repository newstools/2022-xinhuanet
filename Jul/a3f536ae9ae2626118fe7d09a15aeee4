NEW YORK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The state of the pandemic in the United States is getting "foggier" as the number of COVID-19 testing sites across the country has dropped and more states have stopped giving daily data updates, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. "At a glance, the pandemic picture in the United States may seem remarkably stable," the U.S. media outlet reported on Tuesday. "A closer look shows that as public testing sites run by state and local governments have winnowed, more states have also stopped giving daily data updates, creating a foggier look at the state of virus across the country," it said, adding that the spreading Omicron subvariant known as BA.5 has become "dominant" among new coronavirus cases. As of the week ending Saturday, BA.5 made up about 54 percent of new cases across the country, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to an estimate by consulting firm Health Catalysts Group, the reduction in U.S. public testing means that lab-based P.C.R. testing capacity in July will be half of what it was in March.  ■
