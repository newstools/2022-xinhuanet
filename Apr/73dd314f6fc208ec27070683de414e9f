OTTAWA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Indigenous people are overrepresented as victims of violence in Canada and indigenous women in particular experience disproportionately high rates of violence, Statistics Canada said on Tuesday. Overall, more than six in 10 indigenous women, or 63 percent, experienced either physical or sexual assault in their lifetime since age 15, said the national statistical office, releasing results from the 2018 Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces (SSPPS) and the 2019 General Social Survey on Canadians' Safety (Victimization). More precisely, almost 64 percent of First Nations women and 65 percent of Metis women experienced violent victimization in their lifetime, comparing with 45 percent among non-indigenous women, it showed. "Violent victimization against Indigenous people is rooted in the history of colonization that impacted and continues to impact Indigenous families and communities and Canadian society," said the agency. Homelessness was also associated with higher levels of victimization. According to SSPPS, indigenous women (9.4 percent) were about five times more likely than non-indigenous women (1.9 percent) to have ever experienced homelessness. The vast majority, or 91 percent, of indigenous women who reported having experienced homelessness also experienced violent victimization in their lifetime.  ■
