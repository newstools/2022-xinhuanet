LUANDA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has guaranteed continuous support for Angola in its efforts to transit from a least developed country (LDC) to a middle income country. The pledge was made Wednesday by the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Angola, Zahira Virani, at a seminar here on Angola's National Smooth Transition Strategy. She said that the United Nations will continue to help the African country in elaborating the transition strategy while it strives to graduate from the least developed countries list. "The steps and partnership between the government of Angola and the United Nations system towards the national smooth transition strategy have been significant", the UN official said. Also speaking at the seminar, Paul Akiwumi, director of The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) division for Africa, least developed countries and special programmes, stressed that in the transition process formalizing the economy should play a fundamental role. "Angola is a rich country and has natural resources. So it is necessary to plan properly (for it) to move from the current level to another. We are here to help the government of Angola", he said. The seminar on Angola's National Smooth Transition Strategy discussed the elements of the Strategy and assessed the best ways to smooth Angola's graduation from a least developed country to a middle income country.  ■
