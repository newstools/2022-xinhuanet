TUNIS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A merchant ship carrying about 750 tons of fuel sank off the Gabes coast in Tunisia on Friday, the Tunisian authorities said on Saturday. The Tunisian navy rescued all seven crew members of the Equatorial Guinea-flagged vessel, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development said in a statement. The ministry said it is working on preventing an environmental disaster from the incident. The ship sailing from the Egyptian port of Damietta failed to reach its final destination of Malta due to bad weather conditions and the agitation of the sea, said the ministry. The crew sent a distress call seven miles away from the Gabes coast saying the water seeped into the engine room to a height of two meters.  ■
