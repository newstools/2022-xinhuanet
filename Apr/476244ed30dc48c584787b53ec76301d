COPENHAGEN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Danish Industry (DI), the country's largest business organization and employers' association, has been drafting a green social contract between government, businesses and the rest of society outlining a path toward energy independence. According to a press release issued on Monday, the DI expects the green social contract to enable Denmark to achieve this goal while also making the country better by "paving the way for a climate-neutral society." "If the Russians shut down natural gas, or Europe itself decides to turn off the tap, we will be in a supply crisis that we have not experienced since the 1970s...The good thing is that the answer to both crises is the same -- more green transition," said Troels Ranis, industry director at DI Energy, in the press release. According to the DI, Denmark should become a net exporter of green energy by 2030 and should have at least 30 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy installed capacity by 2040. By 2027, the plan aims to make 100 percent of Denmark's gas consumption green and sustainable gas. It also calls for better framework conditions for the national strategy for energy efficiency and sector linkage. The DI argues that green energy generated by a robust infrastructure must ensure 100-percent security of supply for Denmark. Finally, the plan calls for a new green export strategy "that sends even more Danish solutions out into the world and makes a climate difference." "We must use energy much more efficiently than today," Ranis said. "This requires a national strategy for energy efficiency, where laws and regulations are modernized so that they support the green transition, ... as well as massive investments in wind energy, solar energy and biogas." According to the press release, the DI will "present several concrete recommendations and solutions to the government in May." ■
