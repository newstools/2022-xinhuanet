LOS ANGELES, April 28 (Xinhua) -- New COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles, the most populous county in the United States, rose by 40 percent over the past week and hospitalizations have started to creep up as well, local media reported on Thursday. The renewed surge in coronavirus infections underscored "how important it is for people to be up-to-date on their vaccines and boosters, as well as wear masks in indoor public settings," reported The Los Angeles Times, citing public health officials. Although neither the number of infections nor the patient census are setting off alarm bells as yet, the trendlines illustrate that the county is contending with reinvigorated coronavirus transmission, the report noted. Over the last week, the county, home to over 10 million residents, has reported an average of about 1,764 new coronavirus cases per day -- up from 1,261 a week ago, compared with 879 cases a day in early April, according to The Los Angeles Times, which is one of the largest newspapers in the country. Officials said that the Omicron BA.2 variant is the primary culprit behind the uptick in cases in the county, accounting for at least 88 percent of cases here, the newspaper reported. The number of reported infections still remains an important indicator of where the pandemic is heading, and it's not a guarantee that the coronavirus is now destined to mainly result in milder illness, Barbara Ferrer, the county's director of public health, was quoted as saying. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health reported 2,335 new COVID-19 cases and 8 new related deaths on Thursday, bringing the countywide tallies to 2,869,785 and 31,959 respectively.  ■
