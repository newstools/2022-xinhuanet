WINDHOEK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism on Tuesday said they had put down a 10-year-old problem-causing lion that has been terrorizing communities in the Sesfontein and Puros area in the country's Kunene Region. "The lion has been notorious for killing people's livestock since 2019. He has caught 12 cattle, 13 donkeys and 9 goats. The lion has on numerous occasions been observed moving into people's settlements at night posing a threat to their lives. He was also displaying traits that he was not scared of people," spokesperson Romeo Muyunda said in a statement. He said the ministry had to put some preventive measures before the lion was declared a problem-causing animal, adding that the lion was trophy hunted and generated about 10 000 U.S. dollars for the affected communities through conservancies. "Destruction of problem-causing animals is part of our conservation methods particularly in mitigating Human-Wildlife Conflict. Communities who live with wildlife know how crucial this activity is in providing them with relief from destructive and dangerous animals," Muyunda said.  ■
