NEW DELHI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Police in India's northeastern state of Assam have arrested a local legislator from the western state of Gujarat. Jignesh Mevani was reportedly arrested on a complaint filed by a ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader from Kokrajhar in Assam, Arup Kumar Dey over his now-removed Twitter posts on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Indian media reported. A senior police official in Assam's Kokrajhar district told media Mevani was arrested on Wednesday night. Mevani, a staunch critic of the ruling BJP, was elected as an independent legislator from Gujarat's Vadgam constituency. But he extended support to the Congress party last year and said he would contest the state election later this year as a candidate of the party, according to the media report.  ■
