WINDHOEK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Namibia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to increase the repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent, central bank governor Johannes Gawaxab announced Wednesday. The move is to continue supporting domestic economic activity while safeguarding the one-to-one link between the Namibia Dollar and the South African rand, Gawaxab said in a statement at a Monetary Policy announcement event in Windhoek. Namibia's new repo rate is now back on par with South Africa which is also pegged at 4.25 percent.  ■
