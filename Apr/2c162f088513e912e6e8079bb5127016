PHNOM PENH, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Resident Coordinator to Cambodia Pauline Tamesis on Friday commended Cambodia for its success in combating COVID-19, that led to the reopening-up of the country in November last year. Tamesis made the remarks during a farewell call on Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, according to a foreign ministry's press statement. She also underlined the UN's steadfast support for the development of strategies and policies of the Cambodian government toward its sustainable development goals, the statement said. For his part, Sokhonn appreciated the support and assistance provided by the UN, including extensive financial, technical, and operational supports, as well as tremendous amounts of vaccines through COVAX facility and other medical equipment to help Cambodia fight COVID-19. "He underlined Cambodia's pride to be ranked 2nd in Asia Pacific for its successful vaccination campaign that enabled the government to open up the country since November last year," the statement said. Most of the vaccines used in the southeast Asian nation's inoculation drive are China's Sinovac and Sinopharm.
