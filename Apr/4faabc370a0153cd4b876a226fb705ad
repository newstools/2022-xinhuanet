LOS ANGELES, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss the future arrangement of COVID-19 booster shots. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will discuss the need and arrangement for COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, and process for COVID-19 vaccine strain selection to address current and emerging variants, according to meeting information posted on FDA's website. On March 29, the FDA authorized a second booster dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines for certain immunocompromised individuals and people aged above 50. It has recommended that those vulnerable groups get another mRNA COVID-19 booster at least four months after receiving an initial booster dose, to increase protection against severe disease from COVID-19.  ■
