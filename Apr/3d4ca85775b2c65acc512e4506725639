by Dames Alexander Sinaga JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has accelerated its COVID-19 vaccinations, as Muslims across the archipelago country are making their homebound trips for celebrations of the Eid al-Fitr, a festival at the conclusion of the fasting month which falls on Monday next week. To date, the government, which is aiming to fully vaccinate 208.26 million people in the country, has administered over 400 million doses of vaccines, the country's Health Ministry said Thursday, adding that more than 199.19 million people have received their first doses of vaccines, and over 164.65 million the second. Meanwhile, at least 37.45 million people have received booster shots, which have been included in the government's existing vaccine mandates for exodus travelers. "This is a great achievement thanks to the support of the entire community," the Indonesian COVID-19 task force's spokesperson Siti Nadia Tarmizi said in a statement on Thursday. Home to more than 270 million people, Indonesia started mass COVID-19 vaccinations in January last year after the authorities approved the emergency use of the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine. Tarmizi called on the public to continue to encourage people aged above 60 years to get vaccinated because they are at the highest risk of serious symptoms. Meanwhile, health authorities continue to provide vaccination centers across the country, she added. "For those who are going home for Eid, immediately receive booster shots. Prepare ourselves all for good health, so that we can protect ourselves and our families while traveling, upon arrival and when returning from home," she said. Since April 14, the country has recorded less than 1,000 daily cases nationwide, with 412 new cases on Thursday. To date, the total number of COVID-19 infections in the country rose to 6.04 million with 156,217 deaths due to the viral disease.  ■
