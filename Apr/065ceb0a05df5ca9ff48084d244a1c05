NEW YORK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks finished mixed on Friday, weighed by weakness in tech names. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137.55 points, or 0.40 percent, to 34,721.12. The S&P 500 fell 11.93 points, or 0.27 percent, to 4,488.28. The Nasdaq Composite Index decreased 186.30 points, or 1.34 percent, to 13,711.00. Seven of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with energy up 2.76 percent, outpacing the rest. Technology slipped 1.43 percent, the worst-performing group. U.S.-listed Chinese companies traded mostly lower with eight of the top 10 stocks by weight in the S&P U.S. Listed China 50 index ending the day on a downbeat note. Investors continued to digest the U.S. Federal Reserve's March meeting minutes which indicated a more aggressive pace of Fed tightening. The minutes released earlier this week showed that many Fed officials were in favor of a 50 basis point increase at future meetings, and a 95-billion-dollar reduction of balance sheet per month may be enacted soon. The hawkish stance unnerved investors. For the week, the Dow and the S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 3.9 percent.  ■
