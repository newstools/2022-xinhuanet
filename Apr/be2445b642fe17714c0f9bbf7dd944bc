MOSCOW, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is possible only after a peace treaty is ready, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday. "Nothing has changed for us. We do not reject the possibility of such a meeting for our president," Peskov told a daily briefing. "But we repeat once again that such a meeting is possible only after the text of the document is agreed upon," he said. Moscow and Kiev have conducted several rounds of negotiations aimed at finalizing a treaty to end the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.  ■
