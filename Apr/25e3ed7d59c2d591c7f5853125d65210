RABAT, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Moroccan police seized on Sunday more than two tonnes of cannabis ready to be smuggled by sea, official MAP news agency reported. The banned substance, seized in a warehouse located in the town of Melloussa near the northern city of Tangier, was concealed in 61 packages, MAP said. An inflatable boat allegedly used for drug trafficking was also seized, it added. An investigation was opened to pin down the local and international networks of the criminal activity, according to the report. Despite efforts to crack down on cannabis cultivation during the past decade, Morocco remains one of the world's largest producers of the narcotic plant, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.  ■
