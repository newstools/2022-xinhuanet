MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in Metro Manila will remain at the lowest level from May 1 to 15 as the transmission and hospitalization rate remain low in the capital region, the acting presidential spokesperson said Friday. Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said the interagency coronavirus task force approved placing Metro Manila and several areas under alert level 1 until May 15. He said other areas not included in alert level 1 will be under alert level 2. Over 65.7 million Filipinos will go to polling stations on May 9 to elect a new president, a new vice president, 12 of the 24-seat Senate, and members of the House of Representatives. On Thursday, the Commission on Elections said the national and local elections will push through despite detecting the first known case of Omicron sub-variant B.2.12. However, the Department of Health strongly dissuades voters who tested positive for COVID-19 not to go out and isolate. The health department reported 193 coronavirus infections on Thursday. The Philippines now has over 3.68 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 60,267 deaths.  ■
