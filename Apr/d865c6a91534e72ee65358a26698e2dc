CAPE TOWN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's legislative capital Cape Town on Wednesday said it proposes to invest over 50 million South African rand (about 3.4 million U.S. dollars) to install CCTV resources in the 2022/23 financial year for public safety. They will be installed in areas currently not covered by CCTV or those that already have these facilities, the city said in a statement issued here, adding that various areas including Central Business District are set to benefit from the proposal contained in the draft budget. This is part of the city's efforts to contribute to public safety through human and technological resources, Cape Town's Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, Alderman JP Smith, said in the statement. Cameras not only prevent crimes but are also a "force multiplier", providing crucial intelligence and guidance to officers on the ground, said Smith. CCTV operators are able to sound the alarm and dispatch appropriate resources, he added. In February, Cape Town's CCTV system detected 1,287 incidents, which resulted in 31 arrests from 262 crime incidents relayed to responders, according to the city. The city also said like many other critical services that have been damaged or stolen, its CCTV infrastructure is often targeted by criminals.  ■
