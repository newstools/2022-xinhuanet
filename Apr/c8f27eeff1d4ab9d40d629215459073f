COLOMBO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Remittances sent by Sri Lankans working abroad rose to 318 million U.S. dollars in March 2022, from 205 million dollars in February, according to a report issued by the central bank on Saturday. The increase correlates with flexible foreign exchange rates introduced during the first week of March, said the report. However, this is still a drop of 48 percent compared to March 2021, when Sri Lankans sent home 600 million dollars. Between January and March of 2022 Sri Lankans have sent 782.5 million dollars as remittances, according to the report. Remittances were recorded as 5.49 billion dollars in 2021, falling to their lowest level since 2012, said the report. Sri Lanka has been facing forex shortage for the past months, which eroded its ability to import fuel, medicines and other items.  ■
