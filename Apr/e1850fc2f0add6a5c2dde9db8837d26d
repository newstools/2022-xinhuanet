JOHANNESBURG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South African government will target undocumented, vulnerable and those in remote areas in the coming COVID-19 vaccination drive, said the Department of Health on Friday. "A key feature of this Vooma Vaccination Weekend will include the vaccination of vulnerable people, including undocumented citizens and individuals who have lost their identity documents," said Foster Mohale, spokesperson for the department. "Our message as a country has always been that no one will be left behind because no one is safe unless we are all safe. The COVID-19 vaccine is the most effective way of ensuring this is achieved," said Mohale. Mohale said they will vaccinate people at sporting, cultural, and religious events. With effect from April 8, people will be allowed to attend matches at the stadiums. "Following the discussions between government and the Premier Soccer League, there will be vaccination services at the soccer stadiums this weekend, to enable unvaccinated and partly vaccinated soccer-loving fans to vaccinate," he said. The government said before that 70 percent vaccination rate could protect the country against the pandemic.  ■
