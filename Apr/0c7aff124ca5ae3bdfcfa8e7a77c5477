WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- As the United Nations (UN) General Assembly voted to expel Russia from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), why hasn't the United States been kicked out of the UNHRC for war crimes that aren't at all allegations, but are well-documented facts? a recent op-ed published by Eurasia Review asked. The U.S. invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya are illegal, as these countries posed no immediate threat to the United States. However, the U.S. operations were never sanctioned by any UN Security Council Vote, said the article published on Saturday, which was written by Dave Lindorff, a Philadelphia-based journalist and columnist. "The United States is directly responsible for 363,000 civilian deaths -- many of them children -- in the years since September 2001, most of them in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in numerous other illegal bombings of other countries targeted in what the U.S. government has called the War on Terror," the author said.  ■
