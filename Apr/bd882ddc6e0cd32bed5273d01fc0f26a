KAMPALA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and visiting Rwandan leader Paul Kagame on Sunday agreed to push for joint regional peace and stability to address the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Museveni said the problems affecting the region like the crisis in Congo need a collective approach from all regional members of the East African Community, which brings together Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Burundi, South Sudan, and DRC, according to a State House statement issued here Sunday. "This time we must insist on working together because these people have suffered a lot. I told President Kenyatta that if we don't come in as a region, Congo may become like Sudan," Museveni said. President Uhuru Kenyatta is Kenya's president. He hosted a regional heads of state meeting in Nairobi on Thursday regarding the situation in DRC. President Kagame said leaders and all parties must talk to solve the Congolese crisis once and for all. "They need to talk without leaving anyone behind," Kagame said. The regional leaders' meeting held in Nairobi directed all armed groups in the DRC to participate unconditionally in the political process to resolve their grievances. They also directed that a regional force be deployed to fight rebel insurgency in the country. Kagame is in Uganda on a private visit at the invitation of Museveni. Kagame last visited Uganda in March 2018.  ■
