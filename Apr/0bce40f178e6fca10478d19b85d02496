JAKARTA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian ship crew member arrived safely in the capital city Jakarta on Monday, after being detained by Yemen's Houthi militia for 111 days since January, Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a press release. The crew member, named Surya Hidayat, was working for a United Arab Emirates (UAE)-owned ship and sailing in the Al-Hudaydah sea in Yemen on Jan. 3 when he and all the ship crew members were arrested by the Houthis. "We successfully made him released on April 24 with the help from the Indonesian embassies in Muscat (Oman), Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) and Abu Dhabi (UAE). We also intensively communicated with his family in Makassar (Indonesia's South Sulawesi province). After being released, Surya was helped by the Oman government to fly from Sanaa (Yemen) to Muscat," according to the release. Yemen has been mired in a civil war since late 2014 when the Houthi militia, allegedly backed by Iran, seized control of several northern provinces and forced the Yemeni government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by Saudi Arabia, out of Sanaa. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 in the Yemeni civil war in an attempt to reinstate the Hadi government.  ■
