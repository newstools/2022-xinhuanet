ABUJA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed and several others wounded following an attack by extremist militants group Boko Haram in Nigeria's northeastern state of Yobe earlier in the week, police authorities said on Saturday. Heavily armed members of the group moving on motorcycles also torched the staff quarters of a public school in Geidam, a town in Yobe, during the attack on Wednesday, according to Dungus Abdulkarim, a spokesman for the police, who briefed reporters in Damaturu, the state capital. Abdulkarim said the police had already beefed up security in the town, in the first official confirmation of the incident since its occurrence mid-week. "Currently, normalcy has returned and people are going about their normal businesses as security operatives were deployed for patrols and visibility policing to avert future occurrence of the attack," the police official said. Boko Haram has been collaborating with its sister group, Islamic State West Africa Province, to establish an Islamist state in northeast Nigeria. The terror groups have also extended their attacks to other countries in the Lake Chad Basin. ■
