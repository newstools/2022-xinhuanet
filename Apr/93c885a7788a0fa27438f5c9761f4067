RABAT, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Morocco and Spain on Thursday reiterated their will to open a new chapter in the bilateral relations, said a statement issued by the Moroccan Royal Cabinet. Moroccan King Mohammed VI and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, during their talks held in Rabat, pledged to start a new stage in the bilateral ties "based on mutual respect, reciprocal trust, permanent consultation, frank and loyal cooperation," the statement said. They also agreed to take concrete actions in the framework of a roadmap covering all areas of their partnership, the statement added. Bilateral relations between Morocco and Spain deteriorated in April last year, after Spain admitted the Polisario Front leader for medical treatment using Algerian documents. In last month, Spain announced a major shift in its policy by endorsing Morocco's autonomy plan to settle the dispute over Western Sahara, paving the way for easing their strained ties. Sanchez reaffirmed his country's position on the Western Sahara issue, which considers "the Moroccan autonomy initiative as the most serious, realistic and credible basis for resolving the dispute," the statement added. ■
