KABUL, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The hardliner Daesh or Islamic State outfit's activities have been suppressed by 98 percent in Afghanistan and will not be a threat any more, the state-run news agency Bakhtar reported Wednesday. "The phenomenon of Islamic State commonly known as Daesh in Afghanistan has been curbed by 98 percent and could not pose a threat in the country any more," Bakhtar quoting a statement of the Ministry for Interior as saying. Dismissing the reported threats from the hardliner group, the statement asserted, "The Islamic Emirate will never allow Daesh or any other groups to use the Afghan soil against any country." The statement came after the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for twin bomb attacks on a school in Kabul that left scores dead and injured on April 19. Unidentified armed men also killed five commuters on Samangan-Balkh road late Tuesday and no groups or individuals have claimed responsibility.  ■
