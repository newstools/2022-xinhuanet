ISLAMABAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Supreme Court on Thursday declared Pakistani President Arif Alvi's decision to dissolve the National Assembly contrary to the Constitution and restored the government. The apex court also ordered the assembly to summon a session to vote on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The verdict came after the National Assembly rejected the opposition alliance's no-confidence motion against the prime minister on Sunday, declaring it against the country's Constitution. In a short verdict, the Supreme Court said that Khan's advice to the president to dissolve the National Assembly  was contrary to the country's Constitution and has no legal effect. Ordering the restoration of the National Assembly, the court directed the assembly's speaker to summon a session before 10:30 a.m. local time Saturday to fulfill the proceedings on the no-confidence motion. A five-member bench chaired by the country's Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial announced the verdict with a unanimous decision of 5-0. In Sunday's session, Deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament Qasim Khan Suri gave the ruling after listening to the argument of the country's Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, who said that the motion against Khan has been moved after a powerful foreign country wished for "regime change" in the country. Amid the chants of "The Friend of the United States is a Traitor," Chaudhry said that Khan's pursuit of an independent foreign policy has angered the said country, which conspired against Khan.  ■
