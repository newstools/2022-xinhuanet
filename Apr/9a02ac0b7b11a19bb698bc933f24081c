ANKARA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish authorities on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for 91 people, including members of the pro-Kurdish opposition Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). The capital Ankara's chief prosecutor's office said an arrest warrant was issued for 91 suspects for joining the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and being affiliated with acts of "financing terror." Bank account transactions and historical traffic searches on cell phone records were examined, along with the witness testimonies, as part of an investigation into the financial network of the PKK, said the statement. The suspects are accused of "providing financial resources" for the group and for the families of the PKK members who were killed or injured, said the prosecutor's office. Among the suspects are the HDP's former deputy mayors, former party treasurers and assistants, and former city council members, semi-official Anadolu Agency reported. The PKK members received armed training and the members abroad were also among the suspects, the agency reported. At least 46 of them were detained as part of police raids across 13 provinces of Turkey. The Turkish government blames the HDP for being a political front for the outlawed PKK. The HDP, which has 55 seats in the 600-member parliament, denies any links to the group. The PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has been rebelling against the Turkish government for more than three decades.  ■
