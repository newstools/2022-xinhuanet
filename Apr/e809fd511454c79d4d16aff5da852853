MOGADISHU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The special forces of the Somali National Army (SNA), Danab, killed seven al-Shabab militants and wounded others Sunday during a security operation at an area near Wisil town in Hobyo in Mudug region, central Somalia, a senior army official said. Odowa Yusuf Rage, the SNA chief, said the forces also arrested two wounded militants and recovered weapons and a vehicle during the operation. "Our forces recovered weapons, mainly four improvised explosive devices (IEDs), four AK 47 rifles and a vehicle during a special operation in Mudug region under Galmudug State in central Somalia," Rage said. He stressed that the operation targeted the terrorists in the area to reduce their threat in the region, adding that they will continue such operations against the militants until stabilization is restored. The operation came two weeks after Galmudug State concluded parliamentary elections in the region. Government forces have intensified operations against al-Shabab in the southern regions, but the militants are still in control of the rural areas of those regions, conducting ambushes and planting landmines.  ■
