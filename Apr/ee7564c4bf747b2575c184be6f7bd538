ABUJA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of Lassa fever in Nigeria has risen to 132 since the beginning of the year amid ongoing measures by the government to reduce infections across the country, an official has said. Minister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora said in a statement reaching Xinhua on Tuesday that the country has so far recorded 691 confirmed cases, out of a total of 3,746 suspected cases across 23 of Nigeria's 36 states. The case fatality rate has risen to 19.1 percent, owing to the increase in the death toll, Mamora said. Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus. Humans usually become infected with Lassa virus through exposure to food or household items contaminated with urine or feces of infected Mastomys rats. Human-to-human transmission is rare but can occur through contact with the body fluids of an infected person. In some cases, Lassa fever has similar symptoms to malaria, appearing between one and three weeks after exposure to the virus. In mild cases, the disease causes fever, fatigue, weakness, and headache. The Nigeria Center for Disease Control(NCDC) said in an earlier statement that the predominant age group so far affected by the disease ranged between 21 and 30 years. The disease control agency said it is currently distributing medical response commodities to states and treatment centers, as part of measures to control the spread of the disease. Earlier in the year, the NCDC said it had activated the national multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary Lassa fever emergency operations center in response to the outbreak in the country.  ■
