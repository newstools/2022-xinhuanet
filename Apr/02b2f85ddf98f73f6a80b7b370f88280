Biden is not considered a close contact as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the White House official. "Thanks to being fully vaccinated and boosted, I am only experiencing mild symptoms," Bedingfield wrote. "In alignment with White House COVID-19 protocols, I will work from home and plan to return to work in person at the conclusion of a five-day isolation period and a negative test," she added. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the United States has exceeded 81 million, with over 993,000 related deaths, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.  ■
