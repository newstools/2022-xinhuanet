HOUSTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday reported an increase of 1.080 million barrels of crude oil in U.S. inventories for the week ending April 1. Analysts expected a decrease of about 1.558 million barrels for this week. The API reported a decline of 3 million barrels in the previous week. Oil prices declined on Tuesday, giving up some of the solid gains they had scored in the previous session. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May delivery lost 1.32 U.S. dollars, or 1.3 percent, to settle at 101.96 dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude for June delivery decreased 89 cents, or 0.8 percent, to close at 106.64 dollars a barrel on the London ICE Futures Exchange. The weakness came as investors continued to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the outlook of fuel demand. Traders are also awaiting data on U.S. crude stockpiles as U.S. Energy Information Administration is set to release its weekly petroleum status report on Wednesday. On Monday, the WTI and Brent jumped 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively, driven up by the prospect of new Western sanctions against Russia.  ■
