BAGHDAD, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said on Tuesday that the Turkish military operation in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region is a threat to Iraq's national security and a violation of its sovereignty. The latest Turkish military operation into the Iraqi frontier without coordinating with the Iraqi federal government is unacceptable, said a statement by the Presidency. The pending security issues in the border areas could be resolved through further coordination between the two countries and the Iraqi sovereignty must be respected, it added. On Monday, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said in a statement that the Turkish forces launched a new ground and air cross-border operation against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq. Turkish forces regularly carry out ground operations, airstrikes, and artillery bombardments against the positions of PKK militants in northern Iraq, especially the Qandil mountain range, where the main PKK bases are stationed. The PKK is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.  ■
