KABUL, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan received a batch of 32 million U.S. dollars in humanitarian cash assistance on Sunday as the international community continued to provide humanitarian support to the post-war country, according to the country's central bank. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) said on Twitter that "following a series of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, 32 million USD in cash reached Afghanistan on Sunday, April 17, 2022." The DAB also announced the auctioning of 13 million U.S. dollars on Monday to inject foreign currency into the local market and stabilize afghani, the country's national currency. The DAB has been continuously trying to maintain the value of afghani at a fixed and desirable level against the foreign currency, it said. Since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in mid-August last year, the United States has reportedly frozen more than 9 billion U.S. dollars of assets of Afghanistan's central bank and thus undermined the banking system in the war-torn country.  ■
