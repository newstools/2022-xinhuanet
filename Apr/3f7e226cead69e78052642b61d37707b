MADRID, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Spain welcomed 3.15 million tourists in February of this year as the tourist industry continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, said the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) on Monday. The number of foreigners visiting Spain increased by 1,007.8 percent when compared with February 2021, when many travel restrictions were still in place due to the pandemic. Spending also rose strongly, with visitors spending a total of 3,757 million euros in the month, which was 1,060.2 percent up from the figure in last year's same period. Although the signs of recovery continue, INE points out that the number of foreign visitors to Spain accounted for only 71 percent of pre-pandemic figure. The lifting of restrictions has seen a large increase in the number of tourists from other European countries, especially from the United Kindom, France and Germany, according to the INE. Reyes Maroto, Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, said that travelers view Spain as "a safe destination," considering there is "a growth of more than 670,000 travelers in February compared to the previous month." She expected the number of tourists to continue to increase in April, reaching about 80 percent of pre-pandemic figure.  ■
