CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's flag carrier EgyptAir resumed its direct flights to the Libyan city of Benghazi on Monday after an 11-year halt, the Egyptian state media reported. EgyptAir is scheduled to operate a daily direct flight between Cairo and Benghazi with its Boeing B737-800, according to the official Egyptian TV. EgyptAir suspended its flights to Benghazi 11 years ago due to the deteriorating security situation following the fall of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Libya is an attractive market for Egyptian labor, with hundreds of thousands of Egyptians working in different sectors.  ■
