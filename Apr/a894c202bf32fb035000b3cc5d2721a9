YAOUNDE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed early Friday when terror group Boko Haram raided a locality in Cameroon's Far North region, according to local and security sources. Militants of the group invaded Tourou locality of the Mayo-Tsanaga division of the region at 5 a.m. when villagers were still asleep, shot a 40-year-old man and looted property, several locals said. "After that they left, promising to come back and attack the civilians again," a military officer who asked not to be named told Xinhua. Since the beginning of the week, the militants have killed at least three civilians in the locality, according to security reports. Tourou was the epicenter of Boko Haram insurgency in 2014 when the terror group began raids in the region. In June 2014, a group of at least 200 Boko Haram fighters invaded the locality but the army repelled and killed 118 of the fighters, the bloodiest battle of the insurgency in Cameroon, according to the army. ■
