KABUL, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 409 people have received cash assistance in two Afghan provinces as the Taliban-led caretaker government and aid agencies continued to help destitute families, authorities said on Tuesday. In southern Kandahar province, the province's Department of Martyrs and Disabled distributed cash assistance to 104 orphans in Zhari district with each orphan getting 5,000 afghanis (about 57 U.S. dollars) to 9,000 afghanis (about 102 dollars) on Monday, the caretaker government said in a statement. In northern Kunduz province, each of 305 surveyed destitute families received 15,500 afghanis (about 176 dollars) in provincial capital Kunduz city on the same day, Abdul Wali Mohammadi, director of the Refugees and Repatriations Department of Kunduz, told Xinhua. According to Mohammadi, more humanitarian assistance would be provided to needy families in Kunduz in the coming days or weeks. Following the U.S. military defeat and pullout from Afghanistan last August, Washington has imposed sanctions on the Taliban-run administration and frozen more than 9 billion U.S. dollars of Afghanistan's central bank, which battered the economy in the war-torn country.  ■
