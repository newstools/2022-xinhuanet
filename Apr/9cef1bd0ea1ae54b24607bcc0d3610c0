LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 600 people were killed by police in the United States during traffic stops since 2017, with the deaths continuing apace this year, The Guardian reported on Thursday. A review of national police violence data showed that encounters with police during traffic stops, including minor infractions, disproportionately harm people of color, the report said. "Black drivers make up 28 percent of those killed in traffic stops, while accounting for only 13 percent of the population," it said, using data collected by Mapping Police Violence, a non-profit research group. The group also found that black and brown drivers are more likely to be stopped, searched and subjected to force.  ■
