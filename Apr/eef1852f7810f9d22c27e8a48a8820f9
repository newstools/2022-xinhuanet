ABUJA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Monday formally declared his aspiration to run for president in next year's general election in the most populous African country. In a video posted on his official Twitter handle, Osinbajo said he hopes to achieve the aim on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Osinbajo said he is aiming to ride on the opportunity of serving the country for seven years "as vice president under a true Nigerian patriot, a servant of the nation in war and peace, and a man of integrity, President Muhammadu Buhari." "We have, together, worked through some of the most difficult times in the history of our nation, but we have remained focused on securing the country, providing infrastructure, and growing our economy," he said. Osinbajo said his aspiration to run for president was also borne out of the need to complete the work he started with Buhari in 2015, noting the work included radically transforming the security and intelligence architecture, completing the reform of the justice system, focusing on adequate remuneration and welfare of judicial personnel, among others. "I have visited our gallant troops in the northeast and our brothers and sisters in the IDP (internally displaced persons) camps. I have felt the pain and anguish of victims of violent conflicts, terrorist attacks, flooding, fire, and other disasters," he said. "I stood where they stood and sat where they sat." "I know their hopes, aspirations, and fears; and I believe that those hopes and aspirations are the seeds for the great Nigeria that we all desire," he added. Osinbajo, a professor of law, was elected alongside Buhari in 2015 to pilot the affairs of the west African country. The duo was re-elected in 2019 on the platform of the APC.  ■
