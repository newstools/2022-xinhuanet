LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Despite the wariness of a majority of the public, U.S. airline executives and politicians have pressed the government to allow a mask mandate to expire next week, The Financial Times has said. "Forced mask-wearing has caused friction in aircraft cabins," said the newspaper. A record 5,981 reports of unruly passengers were logged in 2021 by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, with 72 percent of them mask-related. The rule requiring travelers to wear a mask on public transport had been set to lapse on April 18. The U.S. government announced Wednesday an extension of the order until May 3 as COVID-19 cases rise. According to the British newspaper on Tuesday, most Americans want to keep the mandate in place. U.S. market research and analytics company Harris Poll found that 60 percent of the people surveyed in early April supported the rule.  ■
