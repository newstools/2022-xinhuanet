CAPE TOWN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A South African lawmaker on Thursday voiced support for the proposed public health regulations under the National Health Act after some others rejected them. The new regulations on COVID-19 and other notifiable medical conditions include public health measures in points of entry, management of human remains and environmental health and others, according to a statement issued by the parliament after a briefing. Kenneth Jacobs, chairperson of the parliament's Portfolio Committee on Health, said the regulations will fill a gap to manage notifiable diseases after the national state of disaster ended and deal with challenges of COVID-19. "There is no way we can say that wearing of masks and other non-pharmaceutical interventions should discontinue," he said. The statement didn't tell why some lawmakers rejected the regulations. Also on Thursday, Michele Clarke, a committee member from the biggest opposition party Democratic Alliance, raised concerns over mandatory quarantine, testing, treatment and preventive actions in a positive case. The new regulations will be finalized and promulgated under the National Health Act after public comment has been taken into account. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this month declared the termination of the national state of disaster, as certain transitional provisions will remain for 30 days and the new regulations will come into effect. South Africa on Thursday reported 1,768 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the national tally to over 3.73 million.  ■
