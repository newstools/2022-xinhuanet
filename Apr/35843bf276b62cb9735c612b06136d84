NEW YORK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A whopping 63 percent of Americans rated the U.S. economy as bad, with 86 percent saying it was because of inflation, closely followed by gas prices at 82 percent, showed a new CBS News poll released on Sunday. In terms of lowering gas prices, the majority of the respondents, at 65 percent, believed that the government "can do more."
