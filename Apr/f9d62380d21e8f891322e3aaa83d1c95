BAMAKO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Malian transitional government has announced the start of a 24-month transition process for the organization of free and transparent presidential elections. Malian transitional Prime Minister Choguel Kokalla Maiga made this announcement on Thursday during the plenary session of the National Transitional Council, which examined the implementation of the Government Action Plan adopted nine months ago. This came after the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in March demanded Mali hold the elections within 12 to 16 months. Maiga assured that Mali would not leave ECOWAS, had no plan to create its own currency, and won't reject the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali in June. After the coup of August 18, 2020, an 18-month political transition was launched in Mali on September 15, 2020, which expired on February 27 this year. Since then, the transitional authorities are still negotiating an extension of this deadline with ECOWAS.  ■
