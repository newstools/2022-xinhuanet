LOS ANGELES, April 3 (Xinhua) -- American R&B superduo Silk Sonic coasted to big wins for Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the 2022 Grammy Awards, while Jon Batiste scored a major Album of the Year award and four other trophies. Silk Sonic, composed of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, took home Record of the Year and Song of the year for "Leave the Door Open" at the Grammys night in Las Vegas. Batiste, who went into the music's biggest night with a leading 11 nominations, won Album of the Year -- the top prize of the Grammys for "We Are." He bested other nine nominees including Olivia Rodrigo, Taylor Swift and the duo of Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga to win the prize. Batiste also won four other awards, including best score soundtrack for visual media, American roots performance, American roots song and best music video. Newcomer Olivia Rodrigo won the award of Best New Artist. The 19-year-old first-time nominee has emerged as one of the front-runners for this year's Grammy Awards with seven nods related to her acclaimed debut album "Sour" and hits "Drivers License," "Deja Vu" and "Good 4 u." Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist, are the four major categories of the Grammy Awards. The 64th Grammy Awards ceremony was postponed from its original date in January to April due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It is the first time that the U.S. music industry's biggest event took place in Las Vegas, Nevada, rather than its usual post in Los Angeles and New York.  ■
