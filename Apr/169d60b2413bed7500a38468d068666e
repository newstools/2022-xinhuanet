ISTANBUL, April 25 (Xinhua) -- At least two people died when a single-engine plane crashed on Monday into a street near the Yunuseli Airport in Turkey's northwestern province of Bursa, local officials announced. Bursa Governor Yakup Canbolat told reporters on the scene that a civilian training plane, which took off from the Yunuseli Airport in the Osmangazi district, crashed after hitting a house, probably for technical reasons.

He also said a comprehensive investigation was launched into the incident. The NTV broadcaster said the accident occurred at around 3:00 p.m. local time (1200 GMT).
