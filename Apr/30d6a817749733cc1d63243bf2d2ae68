BERLIN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of business insolvency filings in Germany increased by 27 percent month-on-month in March, according to preliminary figures published by the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) on Thursday. Since May 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic-related special regulations and financial support for companies have no longer applied. As a result of these regulations, insolvency filings in Germany had previously decreased despite the coronavirus crisis, at times even considerably, according to Destatis. Expecting insolvencies to increase further, Destatis noted that the preliminary number of regular insolvency proceedings filed provided "early indications of the future development of corporate insolvencies." According to the Bankruptcy Update published by the Leibniz Institute for Economic Research Halle (IWH), the number of bankruptcies of private and public limited companies in Germany rose to 775 in March -- a ten percent increase over the February and an almost 30 percent increase over the January figure. Although the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is not yet reflected in the latest figures, the crisis-related increase in energy prices is expected to "weigh heavily" on industry, the IWH noted. The German government has already approved an aid package for companies particularly affected by rising energy prices. "We will cushion hardship and prevent structural breaks," said Minister of Finance Christian Lindner when presenting the measures last week.  ■
