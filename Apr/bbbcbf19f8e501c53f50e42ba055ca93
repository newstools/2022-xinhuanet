BERLIN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Bayern Munich restored its nine-point gap atop the Bundesliga standings and can win its 10th straight title next weekend after easing 3-0 past Arminia Bielefeld on Sunday. The Bavarians started dominantly and needed only 10 minutes to break the deadlock as Bielefeld's Jacob Laursen cleared a Robert Lewandowski shot into the wrong goal. Bielefeld was lucky as Leon Goretzka wasted an opportunity to double the lead seven minutes later. As the match progressed, the hosts were able to hold the pace and thought they had restored parity just before the break, but Masaya Okugawa's goal was ruled offside. Bayern then increased the pressure in the dying seconds of the first half and made it 2-0 through Serge Gnabry, who volleyed past hapless Bielefeld goalkeeper Stefan Ortega. Bielefeld failed to make the most of their chances, as Amos Pieper couldn't beat Bayern goalie Manuel Neuer from a promising position at the hour mark. The German giants controled proceedings and clinically sealed their 23rd Bundesliga win of the season in the closing stages after Jamal Musiala tapped home Lewandowski's cutback. "We played very well in the first 20 minutes. Unfortunately, we were only able to establish a 1-0 lead. That is why Bielefeld believed in a comeback while we lost a bit of structure in our game. All in all, it was a deserved win," said Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann. "You don't get a lot of chances against Bayern. If you want to hijack points you have to utilize them. The team didn't give up. We want and should reap points in the next encounter at Cologne," said Bielefeld coach Frank Kramer. Elsewhere, Union Berlin increased its chances of a top-six finish after beating in-form Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 with first-half goals from Taiwo Awoniyi and Grischa Promel. Hoffenheim shared the spoils with bottom side Greuther Furth following a goalless draw, while RB Leipzig rose to third after beating Bayer Leverkusen thanks to Dominik Szoboszlai's strike.  ■
