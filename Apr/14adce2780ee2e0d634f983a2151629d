BERLIN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Most young Germans say environmental and climate protection are top of their list of concerns, the Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) said on Friday. A survey of more than 1,000 young Germans between the ages of 14 and 22, carried out by BMUV and the German Environment Agency (UBA), showed 85 percent ranked these issues among the top four. Although three quarters were generally optimistic about their own future in  20 years' time, just under 90 percent also felt sad about the environmental destruction caused by humans. "Young people are optimistic about their personal futures but deeply concerned about the future of our planet," said Steffi Lemke, Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection. Politics must keep an eye on the long-term challenges in times of acute crisis, she added, and find solutions. Three quarters of young Germans are afraid of the consequences of the climate crisis, the study found, while 81 percent called for policymakers to listen more to young people's demands regarding climate issues. "The coming years up to 2030 are now crucial for setting the course towards sustainability and climate neutrality," said President of the German Environment Agency (UBA) Dirk Messner. For 88 percent of young Germans, the state of the education,healthcare systems, and social justice, were also particularly important.  ■
