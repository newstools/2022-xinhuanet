ALGIERS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Foreign Ministry on Saturday hailed the truce reached in Yemen, calling on the warring parties to build on it to reach a sustainable peace agreement. "Following the announcement of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg that a two-month cease-fire has been reached coinciding with the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan (Saturday), Algeria welcomes such a step, hoping to become a cornerstone for a sustainable peace agreement and ultimately settle the crisis in this brotherly country," reads a statement of the ministry. Algeria "supports all efforts and initiatives aimed at settling the crisis in Yemen," including the peace talks hosted by Saudi Arabia, it added. After an eight-year war that provoked a severe humanitarian crisis and claimed thousands of civilian victims, the two warring parties in Yemen's ongoing conflict, namely the Saudi-backed government and Houthi militia, agreed to put down their arms.  ■
