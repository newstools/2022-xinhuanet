CHICAGO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell on Friday as U.S. dollar goes strong. The most active gold contract for June delivery fell 30.3 U.S. dollars, or 1.55 percent, to close at 1,923.7 dollars per ounce. Gold fell 1.6 percent for the week. U.S. Labor Department reported on Friday that the United States created 431,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate slid to 3.6 percent from 3.8 percent. This may support the Federal Reserve's aggressive increase of the interest rates. Falling commodity prices also dampened gold. U.S. benchmark oil prices fell below 100 dollars a barrel. Silver for May delivery fell 47.9 cents, or 1.91 percent, to close at 24.654 dollars per ounce. Platinum for July delivery fell 7.2 dollars, or 0.72 percent, to close at 988.6 dollars per ounce.  ■
