NEW YORK, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer sentiment index for February showed a stunning drop of 8.2 percent from January, and the mood of consumers fell to the worst in a decade, according to a report published by the U.S. News and World Report website. The overall index stood at 61.7 in February, down from 67.2 a month earlier and 19.7 percent below what it was a year ago, according to a survey released by the University of Michigan on Friday. The conditions index stood at 68.5 in February, down from 72 a month ago and more than 20 percent off from February 2021, the data showed. The latest mood of consumers is the worst in a decade, according to the report on Friday. "The recent declines have been driven by weakening personal financial prospects, largely due to rising inflation, less confidence in the government's economic policies, and the least favorable long term economic outlook in a decade," Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement. "Importantly, the entire February decline was among households with incomes of 100,000 U.S. dollar or more. Their sentiment index fell by 16.1 percent from last month, and 27.5 percent from last year," Curtin added. Tensions between the United States and Russia over Ukraine, spiking prices on everything from eggs to gas and fatigue from two years of a global health pandemic are all weighing on the minds of consumers, the report said. Curtin also said that households have amassed substantial savings and reserve funds due to more limited consumption choices, especially services.  ■
