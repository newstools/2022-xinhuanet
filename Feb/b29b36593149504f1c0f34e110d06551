COLOMBO, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has registered over 8,303 cases of the dengue virus in 2022, of which 7,702 cases were reported in January, local media reported Friday. Although the threat of the dengue virus has declined when compared to the latter part of last year, the number of cases would remain at a moderate level in the coming months as well, the local Daily Mirror quoted Shilanthi Seneviratne from the National Dengue Control Unit as saying. "The highest number of cases have been recorded from Western Province and it is 42 percent of the total cases," Seneviratne said. Medical experts urged the public to seek immediate medical service if they suffer high fever, uncontrolled vomiting, abdominal pain, or dizziness among other symptoms of dengue fever.  ■
