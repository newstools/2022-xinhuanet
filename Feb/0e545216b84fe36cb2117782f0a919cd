ALGIERS, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Algerian counterterrorism troops on Saturday killed seven "terrorists" near the locality of Collo in the northern coastal province of Skikda, said a statement of the Ministry of National Defense. "Thanks to efficient use of intelligence, army troops on Saturday morning killed seven terrorists, following a counterterrorism operation carried out at the upper woods of the locality of Collo," the ministry statement said, adding the operation is still underway. The army also seized six Kalashnikov-type submachine guns, a sniper rifle, large quantities of ammunition, communication tools, clothing and medicines, among others, according to the statement.
