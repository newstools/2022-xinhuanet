BERLIN, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Siemens' revenues rose by a comparable 9 percent year-on-year to 16.5 billion euros (18.8 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter (Q1) of fiscal 2022 that started in October last year, the German technology giant said Thursday. After 1.5 billion euros in Q1 last year, Siemens generated a net income of 1.8 billion euros, according to the company. At the same time, orders skyrocketed by 42 percent to reach 24.2 billion euros. "We had a very successful start into fiscal 2022. All our businesses continued their high-value growth," said Roland Busch, president and CEO of Siemens. Due to the ongoing pandemic, cost inflation and global supply issues, "the macro economic environment also remains challenging." The company's most important segment, digital industries, saw a 67 percent increase in orders to reach 7.1 billion euros. At the same time, revenues in the segment also grew by 11 percent to reach 4.3 billion euros. Revenues in China increased by 5 percent year-on-year in the first quarter to 2.4 billion euros, while orders even grew by 35 percent to 3.3 billion euros, according to Siemens. For the full fiscal year 2022, Siemens continues to expect mid-single-digit percentage growth in revenues with an annual profit similar to last year's at 1.5 billion euros. Following the announcement, shares of Siemens rose by more than 5 percent, making the company the biggest winner in the DAX at late trading on Thursday. (1 euro = 1.14 U.S. dollars)  ■
