In addition, there are 79 new cases detected at the New Zealand border, said the ministry. There are eight COVID-19 patients currently being treated in New Zealand hospitals, with none in the intensive care unit. The country has recorded 16,245 cases of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, including 12,131 cases from the current community outbreak, said the ministry. To date, about 94 percent of the eligible people in New Zealand are fully vaccinated with at least two doses, the ministry said, adding that more than 1.32 million boosters, or the third doses, have been administered. Over 169,000 children in the 5-to-11-year-old group have received their first dose. The ministry urges everyone in New Zealand to act as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 is transmitting in the community. People are encouraged to wear a mask, keep a physical distance from each other, and use the contact tracing app when going outdoors. People in New Zealand are also encouraged to take their booster jab of the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible.  ■
