NEW DELHI, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian border guards said it has seized 11 Pakistani fishing boats near the western state of Gujarat. India's Border Security Force said in a statement issued Thursday night that the Pakistani boats and fishermen had intruded into the Indian territory. A local media report Friday said three Pakistani fishermen have also been apprehended. Fishermen of the two countries are often jailed for accidentally crossing into each other's territorial waters as fishing boats usually lack technologies to locate exact positions. Last month, New Delhi and Islamabad Saturday exchanged a list of fishermen languishing in each other's jails.  ■
