TRIPOLI, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- A British medical team has started performing heart surgeries in the Libyan capital Tripoli for children, a local medical official said on Tuesday. "The Muntada Aid UK arrived in Tripoli (on Saturday) to perform cardiac catheterization surgeries for children," Abdurraoof Fares, director of the National Center for Cardiac Diseases, told Xinhua. According to the Ministry of Health, the center has signed an agreement in 2018 with Muntada Aid UK, under which the organization will provide pediatric cardiology training for the center's medical staff. "The medical team, consisting of six surgeons, specialists and technicians, will perform 50 surgeries over seven days," the ministry said. Due to years of armed conflict and insecurity, Libyan authorities have been struggling to provide proper basic services, mainly healthcare and education, for the people.  ■
