KIEV, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- The virtual art exhibition "Qin -- the Past and Present of Terracotta Warriors" is being launched in Ukraine on Tuesday, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year of the Tiger. The exposition allows Ukrainians to explore the world-renowned Chinese treasures from their homes. It was organized by the Chinese Embassy in Ukraine and the Department of Culture and Tourism of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, with the support of Ukraine's State Agency for Tourism Development. Focusing on history, heritage, arts, and cultural activities, the exhibition showcases old customs in Shaanxi Province, as well as the history of the discovery and creation of the Terracotta Army through modern innovative technologies. The show is presented in seven parts: "The Ebbs and Flows of History," "The Past and the Present of Terracotta Warriors," "Ancient Workmanship," "Originality from Chinese and Western Culture," "Visiting Shaanxi," "From the Past to the Present" and "Unusual and Wonderful Rhythm." Discovered in 1974, the Terracotta Warrior army was built by Emperor Qinshihuang of the Qin Dynasty (221 B.C.-207 B.C.), who unified China for the first time. As part of celebrations aiming to create a festive Chinese Lunar New Year atmosphere, the virtual exposition will be available online for the Ukrainians until April.  ■
