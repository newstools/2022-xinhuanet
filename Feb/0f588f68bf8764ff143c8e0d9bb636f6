JAKARTA, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- International travelers who have received COVID-19 booster vaccines are allowed to enter Indonesia with a three-day quarantine period, Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investment Affairs Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said on Monday. Starting from next week, the quarantine period for inbound travelers, both foreigners and Indonesian citizens who have received booster vaccines, can be reduced to three days, Pandjaitan told a virtual press conference. They are required to carry out entry and exit polymerase chain reaction swab tests and are allowed to leave the quarantine center if the latest result is negative. For those who have been vaccinated with two shots, the quarantine period is up to five days. The Southeast Asian country is currently grappling with the third wave of COVID-19 triggered by the more contagious Omicron variant. The authorities limited the capacity of working from the office to a maximum of 50 percent for areas of high COVID-19 transmission while the rest work from their homes.  ■
