JAKARTA, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Police announced Thursday that they have arrested three suspected terrorists affiliated to the Islamic State-linked terrorist group Jamaah Islamiyah (JI) in the Indonesian province of Bengkulu. The National Police's spokesman Ahmad Ramadhan said the three suspects arrested by anti-terrorism unit Densus 88 on Wednesday were allegedly affiliated to the JI's networking in North Sumatra, Riau and South Sumatra provinces. "They have pledged allegiance to the JI since 1999," he told reporters in Jakarta. According to Ramadhan, the suspects have played roles in raising funds and helping those suspects who are on the police's wanted list. The JI is an organization that has long been accused of being behind a series of bomb attacks in Indonesia. The deadliest attack was the bombing of two nightclubs in Bali on Oct. 12, 2002, which killed 202 people.  ■
