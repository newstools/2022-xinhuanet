OTTAWA, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of protesters moved to the Ottawa airport on Thursday morning as the protest reaches the end of its second week, according to local media. About 30 pickup trucks arrived at the airport and began driving slowly around the loop in both the arrivals and departures lanes, CTV reported. One of the organizers said that they planned to stay and slow-roll the airport for "hours," CTV said. The "Freedom Convoy 2022" protest began on Jan. 29 as a rally of truckers against the requirement that Canadian truck drivers crossing the border into the United States be fully vaccinated as of mid-January.  ■
