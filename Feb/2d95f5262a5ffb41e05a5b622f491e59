BERLIN, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- To offset the effect of rising energy prices, the German government decided on Wednesday to provide a one-time heating allowance to around 2.1 million people in the country. Support would be provided in particular to housing benefit recipients and students receiving financial support, it said. Housing benefit recipients who live alone would receive 135 euros (153 U.S. dollars), two-person households would get 175 euros, while students are to receive 115 euros, according to the government. Pensioners, single parents or people with little income "have not been able to easily shoulder the rising energy prices," Minister of Housing, Urban Development and Construction Klara Geywitz said. These people should receive "tangible support with the heating cost subsidy." The one-time heating allowance would be paid in summer, when heating or utility bills are usually due, according to the government. The draft law is now to be presented to the Bundestag (lower house of Parliament). (1 euro = 1.13 U.S. dollars)  ■
