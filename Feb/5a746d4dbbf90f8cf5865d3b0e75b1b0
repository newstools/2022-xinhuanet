WARSAW, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Polish Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said on Wednesday that the fifth wave of COVID-19 infections in the country seems to have passed its peak. "Two weeks ago we had to deal with a rise in cases," Niedzielski said during a press conference. "The downward trend is now a permanent trend." Poland reported 46,872 new cases on Wednesday morning, almost 10,000 fewer than on the same day a week earlier. Since the start of the pandemic, 107,204 Poles died due to the coronavirus. Speaking to local media in an interview published on Wednesday, Niedzielski said he will recommend gradual easing of current restrictions. Poland has a masking mandate in place for public indoor spaces and public transport, as well as capacity restrictions for businesses and institutions and distance learning for all levels of education. "The first decision will be to scale down the hospital infrastructure set up to combat COVID-19," he said in the interview. "After that, we will walk back restrictions step-by-step. If the current trend continues, lifting restrictions by March will be a realistic perspective." He added that a return to the classroom for students would enjoy priority. Niedzielski also said a shortening of the quarantine period from ten days to seven is on the table, as well as quarantine requirements for those who had confirmed contact with a COVID-19 patient.  ■
