ROME, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- Multinational carmaker Stellantis announced on Wednesday that it had achieved 3.2 billion euros (3.6 billion U.S. dollars) in cost savings in 2021, its first year as a combined company. Formed in January 2021 after a merger between Italian-American vehicle maker Fiat-Chrysler and its French rival Peugeot, Stellantis said it is benefiting from increased efficiency due to the merger. For the full year, the company said it earned 152 billion euros (171 billion U.S. dollars), with a net profit of 13.4 billion euros (151 billion U.S. dollars). Meanwhile, revenue was up by 14 percent compared to the 2020 revenues of the separate component companies, while profits nearly tripled year-on-year. "Today's record results prove that Stellantis is well-positioned to deliver strong performance, even in the most uncertain market environments," Stellantis' CEO Carlos Tavares said on Wednesday. As was the case for most car makers, sales for Fiat-Chrysler and Peugeot were lower in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19. Stellantis said the company's strategy after the merger would be focused on three main areas: increased efficiency from the elimination of duplicate operations, making inroads into the Chinese market, and focusing on developing a line of electric, hybrid, and autonomous vehicles.  ■
