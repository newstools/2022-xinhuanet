CAPE TOWN, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday said the Solidarity Fund, which receives public donations for fighting COVID-19, has played a "pivotal role" in supporting the national response to the pandemic. "The fund raised 3.4 billion rands (about 220 million U.S. dollars) from more than 300,000 individuals and 3,000 companies and foundations. More than 400 individuals and 100 companies volunteered their time and services," Ramaphosa said during his annual State of the Nation Address. The president thanked everyone who contributed to the fund which was launched in 2020, adding that the country has had to adapt and evolve as the trajectory of the pandemic has continued to change. According to Ramaphosa, with nearly 42 percent of all adults and 60 percent of those over 50 having been fully vaccinated, the country is ready to "enter a new phase in our management of the pandemic." "If we all get vaccinated, continue to observe basic health measures and remain ever vigilant, we will be able to get on with our lives even with the virus in our midst," he said. Nearly all restrictions on economic and social activity have already been lifted in South Africa. The country on Thursday reported 3,169 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the national tally to 3,634,811.  ■
