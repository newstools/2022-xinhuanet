ROME, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Italy recorded 112,691 new infections on Thursday, a decrease of some 6,300 compared to a day earlier and a reduction of more than 20,000 compared to two days earlier. After plateauing for weeks, weekly totals for Italy's COVID-19 infections dropped over the last seven-day period, data from health monitoring entity GIMBE Foundation showed Thursday. The foundation, which bases its calculations on data supplied by Italy's Ministry of Health, reported that after several weeks of increases, the weekly totals of new infections had held steady at 1.2 million for three weeks in January, but the latest figures totaled over 900,000 for Jan. 26-Feb. 1, recording a decrease of 24.9 percent. The total number of currently positive cases also fell, though by only 7.9 percent, the foundation reported. In an encouraging sign, the number of new cases fell in nearly all regions, ranging from a decline of 7 percent in the central Italian region of Molise to a 46.9-percent fall in the neighboring region of Apulia. The foundation also noted that the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units is decreasing: the total was 1,717 for the week ending Jan. 17 and 1,549 for the week ending Feb. 1.   ■
