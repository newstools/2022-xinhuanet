RABAT, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Morocco and Germany on Wednesday pledged to build "close and friendly relations," and to start a new dialogue to "overcome misunderstandings in their relations." According to a joint statement published here after a virtual meeting between Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita and his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock, both sides "agreed to resume cooperation in all areas and involve all stakeholders." The two ministers stressed the shared interest of both sides to strengthen ties in order to overcome the challenges of the post COVID-19 recovery, the joint statement added. Annalena Baerbock welcomed the return of Morocco's ambassador in Berlin, adding that the new German ambassador would soon arrive in Morocco, the statement said.
