ABUJA, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- At least three persons were killed early Sunday following an attack by gunmen who invaded two villages in Niger, a state in Nigeria's central region, the police said. Monday Bala Kuryas, the police chief in Niger, told reporters in the state capital of Minna that the police have launched an investigation and manhunt for the gunmen who rode on motorcycles into the Ebbo and Ndagbegi villages in the Lavun local government area of the state. The motive of the attack remains unknown, Kuryas said, explaining that the gunmen stormed the villages at about 5 a.m. local time to "commit the dastardly act". According to him, a detachment of police tactical squad and the military have been deployed to the area and have launched a manhunt with a view to tracking down the criminals. "We appeal to residents to assist security personnel deployed with reliable information that could aid in apprehending the miscreants in their midst," he added. Armed attacks have been a primary security threat in Nigeria's northern and central regions, leading to deaths and kidnappings in recent months.  ■
