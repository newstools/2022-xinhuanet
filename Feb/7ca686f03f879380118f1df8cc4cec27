ISLAMABAD, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday launched the second phase of the country's first instant payment system called "Raast" to enable person-to-person payments. Addressing a ceremony, Khan said the newly launched initiative will not only enable common people to execute digital payments instantly, securely and conveniently without paying any fee, but also help the government maintain a record of the largely undocumented economy of the country. "Through the digitization of the economy, over 220 million population can be converted into an asset by ensuring their financial inclusion in the system," he said. The prime minister said the initiative will open doors of further innovation for the economy and particularly the financial sector. Khan said the outbreak of COVID-19 had a negative impact on the whole world and it increased the global poverty level. Citing a World Bank report, he said that despite the pandemic, poverty level was slightly reduced in Pakistan which is a positive indicator, hoping that the country's economic condition will further improve through Raast and other initiatives. As a flagship initiative of the State Bank of Pakistan, Raast is an instant payment system that enables various types of transactions among different stakeholders such as organizations, businesses and persons, a statement by the central bank said. In the first phase of Raast, launched in January 2021, transactions from organizations to persons, generally referred to as "Bulk Payments," was enabled, the statement said, adding that the second phase is designed to facilitate person-to-person transactions under the initiative.  ■
