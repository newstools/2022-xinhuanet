NEW DELHI, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Popular singer Lata Mangeshkar, fondly called India's Nightingale, passed away at the age of 92 on Sunday. She was admitted to a hospital in Mumbai city for the past couple of weeks. She tested positive for COVID-19 earlier in January. She had recovered with treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) in hospital over the past couple of weeks, but her condition suddenly deteriorated on Saturday. In her singing career spanning over seven decades, Mangeshkar was conferred with many top civilian and cinema awards, including India's highest civilian award "Bharat Ratna." "I am anguished beyond words. The kind and caring Lata Didi has left us. She leaves a void in our nation that cannot be filled," Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, expressing grief over Mangeshkar's demise. "The coming generations will remember her as a stalwart of Indian culture, whose melodious voice had an unparalleled ability to mesmerise people," Modi wrote.  ■
