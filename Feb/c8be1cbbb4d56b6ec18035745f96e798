TEHRAN, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on Wednesday that the U.S. "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran has ended in abject failure in the face of resistance and perseverance. Raisi made the remarks during a visit to the mausoleum of the late founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on the occasion of the 43rd anniversary of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, according to the Iranian presidency's website. The Iranian president noted that the failure of the U.S. pressure policy was an outcome of the Iranians' resistance and perseverance. "If we fulfill our duty and great responsibility correctly, the obstacles will be removed," he said. Over the past 40 years, good measures have been taken and good services provided in different sectors in the country, as the enemy is still making every bid to prevent Iran's Islamic establishment from fully stabilizing and developing, Raisi added. "They, however, have so far failed to achieve success, and will not succeed either in the future," the Iranian president concluded. He called on the entire Iranian nation to join hands and help his administration to solve the country's challenges and problems.  ■
