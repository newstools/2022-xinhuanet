BISHKEK, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- Voters in two constituencies in Kyrgyzstan's capital head to the polls Sunday morning for a rerun of the parliamentary elections as the previous results were declared invalid. A total of 120 polling stations are open in the capital Bishkek in the Pervomaisky and Sverdlovsky constituencies. Over 200,000 voters are eligible to vote. The Central Election Commission registered 52 candidates for the rerun. The country held parliamentary elections on Nov. 28, 2021. However, the voting results of the two constituencies were declared invalid because voters who chose the "against all" option won the majority in the two districts. The "against all" vote, also known as "none of the above," is a ballot option designed to allow voters to indicate disapproval of the candidates in a voting system.  ■
