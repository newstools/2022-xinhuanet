BERLIN, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- New orders in Germany's manufacturing industry in December 2021 increased by 2.8 percent month-on-month and 5.5 percent year-on-year, the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) said on Friday. While international orders decreased by 3.0 percent month-on-month, with a decline of 4.2 percent in the euro area, domestic orders in Germany grew significantly, up 11.7 percent in December last year, according to Destatis. Compared with February 2020, the month before restrictions were imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic in Germany, new orders in December 2021 were 9.8 percent higher. New orders in 2021 as a whole increased by 17.8 percent year-on-year, and 9.3 percent higher than in the pre-pandemic year 2019, according to Destatis. "Following a sharp decline in October, new orders have now recovered twice in a row and remain clearly above pre-crisis levels," the Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action said Friday, stressing that the development was "driven by domestic demand."  ■
