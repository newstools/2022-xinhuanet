LJUBLJANA, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia on Saturday started to ease COVID-19 restrictions as the number of new daily cases had been gradually falling over the past weeks. From Saturday, it is possible to enter Slovenia without a vaccination certificate, a negative COVID-19 test or proof of recovery. In the country, people no longer have to go into mandatory self-isolation after close contact with someone with COVID-19, the government said on its website. The country reported 3,731 new COVID-19 infections on Friday, down from 3,818 a day before and well below the all-time high of 24,230 daily infections registered on Feb. 1, the National Institute of Public Health said on Saturday. Certain other restrictions continue to remain in force, including a face mask mandate in all indoor public spaces and the obligation to present a vaccination certificate, proof of recent recovery from COVID-19 or a negative test before entering most indoor public spaces. Capacity limits will also continue to apply in certain public indoor spaces. Health Minister Janez Poklukar told reporters on Friday that the latter restrictions cannot be lifted until the number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals falls. Almost 900 people were hospitalized on Friday with COVID-19, 103 of them in intensive care, said the minister. According to Poklukar, Slovenia, with a population of 2.1 million, now ranks second in the world in terms of the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care per million citizens.  ■
