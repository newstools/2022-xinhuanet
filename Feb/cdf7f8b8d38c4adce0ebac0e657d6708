BERLIN, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- Munich Re, a Munich-based leading global provider of reinsurance, generated profits of 2.9 billion euros (3.28 billion U.S. dollars) in 2021, despite difficult conditions due to COVID-19 and natural disasters, the German reinsurer said on Wednesday. The company's profits were slightly higher than the target of 2.8 billion euros. "Propelled by this momentum, we will resolutely tap into the favorable market environment," said Munich Re Chief Executive Officer Joachim Wenning, adding that profits should further increase to 3.3 billion euros in 2022. Meanwhile, Munich Re's core reinsurance segment met its profit target of 2.3 billion euros. The cost of major losses due to natural disasters increased significantly from 906 million euros in the previous year, to 3.12 billion euros in 2021. The most expensive disasters were Hurricane Ida in the United States, and storm Bernd in Germany, with losses of 1.2 billion euros and 500 million euros respectively. During the floods that hit parts of Europe in mid-July 2021, entire villages were destroyed, leaving 184 people dead in Germany alone. Several other countries in Europe were also seriously affected. According to the German Insurance Association (GDV), 2021 was the most expensive natural hazard year ever, due to flooding and extreme hail damage. In total, losses in Germany amounted to around 12.5 billion euros. Munich Re's gross premium revenues rose by 8.5 percent compared with 2020, reaching 59.6 billion euros. In 2022, the premium income is expected to further grow to around 61 billion euros.  (1 euro = 1.13 U.S. dollars)  ■
