ABUJA, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's House of Representatives on Wednesday urged the federal government to probe into a recent deadly fire at an oil vessel. The aim of the probe "was to unearth the remote and immediate causes of the explosion to prevent a recurrence," the parliament said. The vessel, operated by Nigeria's Shebah Exploration and Production Company, suddenly caught fire at a port in the southwestern state of Ondo last week, leaving at least three people dead. The country's economy was impacted by the explosion of the vessel, which had about 50,000 barrels in storage, and it may take a long time to recover, the parliament said, noting the surrounding coastal communities may feel the repercussions as well, including water pollution, death of aquatic animals, and dispersal of surviving fish. On Monday, Nigeria's Minister of State for the Environment Sharon Ikeazor said in a statement that the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency had launched an overflight to monitor the situation of a crude oil spill in the affected area.  ■
