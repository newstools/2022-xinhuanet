NICOSIA, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and France completed a joint air defense exercise on Monday, which aimed at testing the capability of the eastern Mediterranean island's air defense systems, the Cypriot Defense Ministry said in a press release. It said that as part of the exercise, code-named "Talos 2022," French Rafale planes carried out simulated attack sorties over parts of Cyprus. "The exercise involved the entry of a formation of fighter aircraft at low altitude ... The main purpose of the exercise was to evaluate the response of the air defense system and to train the personnel of the National Guard in realistic conditions," the press release said. The exercise was performed on the occasion of the presence of the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle in the wider region of the Eastern Mediterranean. The aircraft carrier has taken part in several exercises with Cypriot air and air defense forces as part of a bilateral defense cooperation agreement between Cyprus and France. The exercise, said the press release, "sends a very positive signal about the willingness of both countries for cooperation in order to strengthen even more the bilateral ties in the domain of security and defense."  ■
