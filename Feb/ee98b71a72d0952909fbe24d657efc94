DAR ES SALAAM, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian information, communication and technology (ICT) authorities on Friday urged police to intensify the fight against cyber attacks. "Police should learn on the best ways of fighting cyber attacks for the security of the country," said Jim Yonazi, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Information, Communication and Information Technology. Yonazi made the call when he opened a meeting in the capital, Dodoma, on cyber security attended by police officers and a committee of experts dealing with cyber attacks. Director of Criminal Investigations Camilius Wambura said cyber attacks are a threat not only to Tanzania but also across the globe. In July 2020, Tanzania's communications regulator issued an alert over cyber attacks, saying between 10 and 15 organizations based in the country had reported cases of such attacks.  ■
