MOGADISHU, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and five others injured in an explosion in Bosaso town in northeast Somalia Saturday, the police said. Puntland police told State-owned Radio Mogadishu that an improvised explosive device (IED) exploded at a busy tea shop in the town around 6:30 p.m. "Two people were killed and five others wounded in a terrorist bomb attack targeting a tea shop in Bosaso town of Puntland state," the state-owned radio reported. The police said the latest blast, which came a few hours after another attack in the central town of Beledweyne killed ten people and wounded 15 others, targeted at electoral delegates who participated in the ongoing Lower House elections Friday. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab insurgents have carried out a string of similar bombings in the past in  Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and elsewhere in Somalia. The militant group claimed responsibility for the suicide attack in Beledweye which has been condemned by Prime Minister Mohamed Roble. Roble sent his condolences to the families of the victims and wished speedy recovery for the wounded.  ■
