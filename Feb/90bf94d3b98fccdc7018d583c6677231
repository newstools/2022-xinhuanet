by Yosley Carrero HAVANA, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a group of Cuban young environmentalists have been collecting recyclable waste from the Quibu river mouth in the country's capital Havana to prevent it from polluting the ocean. Among them is Lorena Avila, a 24-year-old state employee who graduated from the University of Havana one year ago and now volunteers for environmental causes during her leisure time. She joined Green Network, a collaborative platform gathering Havana-based environmental groups aiming to raise awareness about the necessity to protect Nature. "I believe the work we do is fundamental to protecting Nature. We can very much contribute to combating environmental contamination," she told Xinhua. Flowing 11 km, Quibu river is considered the second largest in the Cuban capital as sewage from seven out of the city's 15 municipalities is discharged into this river. Wearing face masks and gloves, environmentalists collect plastic and glass waste that could end up in the ocean otherwise. University student Carlos Pimentel, 22, said that they had created social media groups to urge people to keep the island's rivers and beaches clean for the present and future generations of Cubans. "We are just doing our part to tackle contamination in urban rivers, which is a critical topic worldwide," he said. "I have no doubt that more people will join us in the coming months." Cuban researcher Dayna Rodriguez told Xinhua that although more community actions to save the rivers were required, the cleaning teams' work had made a positive impact on restoring the biodiversity of ecosystems. "This is very important for protecting plants and animals living by the riverbanks and marine life as well," she said. "We want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem."  ■
