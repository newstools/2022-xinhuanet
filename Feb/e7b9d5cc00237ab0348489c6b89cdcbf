TEHRAN, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. sanction waiver on Iran is "insufficient" to revive the 2015 nuclear deal,  Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Saturday. Iran is waiting for the United States to fulfill its duties and obligations regarding the lifting of sanctions, Khatibzadeh told Jamaran news website. "The news we hear today is about a dimension of lifting nuclear sanction, and everyone knows that this is not enough," Khatibzadeh said, adding that "what the United States needs to do is to lift all sanctions, including the nuclear sanctions." The U.S. government on Friday restored the sanction waiver to Iran to allow international nuclear cooperation projects, while the Vienna talks, which were initiated about 10 months ago to restore the JCPOA, have now reached a crucial stage.  ■
