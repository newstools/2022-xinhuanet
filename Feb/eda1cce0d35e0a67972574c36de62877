(Xinhua/Marios Lolos) ATHENS, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Montenegro expects Greece's continued support for its accession to the European Union (EU), visiting Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic said here on Tuesday. "We are taking important steps towards the European integration of our country, and we expect Greece to continue to support us," Djukanovic said during his meeting with his Greek counterpart, Katerina Sakellaropoulou. "Greece believes that in times of growing global challenges, such as the period we are going through, the European perspective of the western Balkans, their full membership of the European Union, is in the political and economic interest of the European Union itself, but also an incentive for these countries to make the necessary reforms," Sakellaropoulou said. Both leaders stressed the special significance of Djukanovic's two-day official visit to Athens. He is the first Montenegrin head of state to visit Greece since 2006, when the country declared its independence and the confederation of Serbia and Montenegro peacefully dissolved. Djukanovic also talked about the EU integration when met with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, according to the Greek national broadcaster ERT. ■  Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis (L) welcomes Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic in Athens, Greece, on Feb. 8, 2022.
