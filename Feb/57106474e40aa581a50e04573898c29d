ABUJA, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and six others came out unhurt after a tanker laden with petrol exploded Wednesday in Nigeria's southwestern state of Ogun, local police said. Three vehicles and a motorcycle were involved in the incident that occurred in Sagamu, a town located along the ever-busy Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ahmed Umar, a commander of the state's Federal Road Safety Corps, told reporters. The tanker suddenly exploded on motion, said Umar, who attributed the incident to "excessive speeding" of the tanker driver. The fire has been put off, and traffic has been diverted, the official said, urging motorists to drive cautiously and adhere strictly to traffic rules.  ■
