DAR ES SALAAM, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 percent of Tanzania's population of about 60 million people use traditional medicines for treating various diseases, a health ministry official has said. Most of those Tanzanians get treated by traditional medicines against various diseases before or after seeking treatment in health centers or hospitals that provide modern healthcare services, Caroline Damian, director of Healthcare Services in the Ministry of Health, told a seminar in the capital, Dodoma, Thursday evening. The seminar, which brought together practitioners in traditional medicines from across Tanzania, was aimed at exchanging experiences among the herbalists and discussing various challenges and strategies to improve the traditional and alternative medicines, according to a Health Ministry statement. Damian said the Ministry of Health, through the Traditional and Alternative Health Practice Council, has so far managed to register 73 types of traditional medicines, out of which 20 had great positive results in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.  ■
