LOS ANGELES, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Heat advisories were issued Tuesday for Southern California, including Los Angeles and other counties, with the possibility of record high temperatures starting Wednesday and lasting through the weekend. "HEAT ADVISORY now in effect from Wed morning through Sun afternoon. Highs will reach 85-90 degrees each day: 15-20 degrees above normal! This can lead to wintertime heat stress, especially those who are not used to this kind of heat. Take extra precautions this week," the National Weather Service (NWS) Los Angeles Office tweeted Tuesday. Ninety degree fahrenheit is over 32.2 degree celsius. In Southern California, February's normal daily high temperatures are around 68 degree fahrenheit (20 degree celsius). The NWS predicted that near record high temperatures are possible during the peak of the heat wave in winter. "This is unseasonably hot, so many people will not be acclimated to this heat leading to faster onset dehydration and heat stress. Please, take precautions and stay safe this week," the agency warned. The summer-like weather is driven by a high pressure system heading east and marking the first of many Santa Ana wind events, said the NWS, adding the system was expected to arrive in Southern California Tuesday night.  ■
