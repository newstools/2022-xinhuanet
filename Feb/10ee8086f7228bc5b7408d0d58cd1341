LONDON, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan resigned on Thursday, as part of the protest staged by his party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), against the post-Brexit trade arrangements known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. "Today marks the end of what has been the privilege of my lifetime," Givan told reporters as he resigned, a day after one of his ministers tried to halt the inspection of goods arriving from British mainland, a move that violated the Northern Ireland Protocol and angered the European Union (EU). The Northern Ireland Protocol, as part of the agreed rules following Britain's departure from the EU, means goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could continue to be sent seamlessly across the border which is now the only EU frontier within the British Isles. However, a de-facto border was created down the middle of the Irish Sea, which has long been heavily criticized by the DUP and businesses saying it has made it more difficult to send goods to Northern Ireland from the British mainland. "Our institutions are being tested once again. And the delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrews agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom government and the European Union which created the Northern Ireland protocol," Givan said. His resignation means Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn Fein party, with whom he shared power, automatically resigns from office. It's understood that other ministers in the Northern Ireland executive will remain in office place to implement previously agreed policy but can take no new decisions. In response, Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald has called for an early election for the Northern Ireland Assembly. "I want to be clear, we cannot stagger on in the months ahead without a functioning executive. Sinn Fein will not facilitate this," she said.  ■
