YAOUNDE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- At least five people have been abducted and another person killed in Cameroon's North region, according to security and local sources. Gunmen raided Siri village in Touboro subdivision of the region Sunday morning, abducted five civilians, and killed a 54-year-old man who refused to follow them, security sources said. Local media reported that those kidnapped included three children aged between 10 and 12, a woman and a 38-year-old man. The abduction comes barely 10 hours after a breastfeeding mother and her baby and a girl were kidnapped in Ladde village of the region. Touboro, a subdivision in the region has been at the center of numerous kidnapping cases in the past month, according to security reports. In early May, the army said its troops in collaboration with members of community defense forces had freed five hostages including four women and a man in the subdivision. Gunmen, mostly rebels escaping from the neighboring Central African Republic have been blamed for the abductions, according to the army.  ■
