UNITED NATIONS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemns the recent attacks in Afghanistan's capital Kabul and northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, which have claimed the lives of numerous civilians, said his spokesman on Thursday. "The secretary-general extends his deepest condolences to the families of the victims and wishes a swift recovery to those injured. Attacks against civilians and civilian objects, including mosques, are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law," said Stephane Dujarric, the spokesman, in a statement. "The secretary-general reiterates his call on all parties to ensure the protection of civilians, including ethnic and religious minorities, as well as their right to freely practice their religion," said the statement. At least 14 people were killed and 32 others wounded in four explosions that rocked Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif on Wednesday, authorities said. In Kabul, at least five worshippers were killed and 17 others wounded after a blast ripped through the Hazrat-e-Zekria Mosque during evening prayers. The blast came about one hour after three consecutive explosions struck three van-buses in Mazar-i-Sharif, killing nine people and wounding 15 others.  ■
