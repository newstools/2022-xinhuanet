LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's anti-graft agency has arrested the country's Accountant General of the Federation (AGF), Ahmed Idris, over alleged diversion of funds and money laundering activities. Idris was arrested on Monday by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) after failing to honor the commission's invitations to respond to issues connected to the fraudulent acts to the tune of 80 billion naira (about 193 million U.S. dollars), said Wilson Uwujaren, an EFCC spokesperson. "The commission's verified intelligence showed that the AGF raked off the funds through bogus consultancies and other illegal activities using proxies, family members and close associates," said Uwujaren in a statement on Monday evening. He said the funds were laundered through real estate investments in Nigeria's northwest state of Kano and in Abuja, the country's capital. Idris, born in November 1960 in north Nigeria's Kano state, was appointed as Accountant General of the Federation in 2015.  ■
