VALLETTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Malta's thriving agriculture and fisheries sectors were showcased in the first-ever AgriFair this weekend after it had to be postponed twice due to the COVID-19  pandemic. Organised by the Ministry for Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Animal Rights, the aim of the AgriFair was to showcase local produce, machinery, systems and technological developments in the agricultural and fisheries sectors. The Malta AgriFair 2022 took place between Friday and Sunday at the Malta Fairs and Convention Center in Ta' Qali. Agriculture plays an important role in Malta's economy and the event offered a platform for both the local farming community and producers to inform the public about the industries' products and services, according to the organisers. Attendees acquainted themselves better with the farm-to-fork concept, as the food chain system of food production, harvesting, processing, distribution and consumption were demonstrated in a visual and interactive manner, including a show of farm animals. There were various live fish on display in a range of aquariums while mini-fields were set up to showcase different crops, trees, and vines as well as a massive honeycomb structure.  ■
