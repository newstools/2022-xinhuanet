ADDIS ABABA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The African Union (AU) Commission on late Tuesday evening issued a statement condemning the attack on an African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) forces base in Somalia. In a press statement, the AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat said he strongly condemns the terrorist attack perpetrated by al-Shabab militants against the ATMIS base in the Middle Shabelle region. "The chairperson pays tribute to the Burundian peacekeepers who lost their lives helping to bring peace and stability to Somalia," said Mahamat. The chairperson also said the latest attack on the ATMIS base will only help to reaffirm a continued and unwavering commitment of the AU to support the Somalia government and people in their pursuit to achieve sustainable peace and security. Mahamat further called on the international community to increase support to the Somalia security services and the ATMIS mission commensurate with the security challenges at hand. On Tuesday, local security officials told Radio Mogadishu that two loud explosions hit the ATMIS base manned by the Burundian troops followed by an exchange of gunfire between the troops and the militants. Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack. The insurgent group has carried out many deadly attacks targeting AU camps across Somalia.  ■
