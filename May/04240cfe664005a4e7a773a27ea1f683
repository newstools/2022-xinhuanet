MEXICO CITY, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Mexico on Wednesday welcomed steps to resume national conciliation talks between the Venezuelan government and alliance of opposition groups, which held the last dialogue in the Mexican capital in 2021. "The announcement of the resumption of dialogue between Venezuela's Government and Venezuela's Unitary Platform (is) very positive," Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard tweeted. Mexico is "ready and willing to welcome you and help make it a success," he added, in the wake of recent announcements from representatives of the government and opposition delegations to the talks last year. The head of the government delegation, Jorge Rodriguez, tweeted that he met Tuesday with opposition leader Gerardo Blyde with a view to "revive" the stalled talks. Rodriguez hailed the meeting as a "work meeting for future plans, to revive the spirit of (conciliation seen in) Mexico." Also on Tuesday, Blyde released a statement on behalf of the Unitary Platform, reporting the start of "formal talks" with government representatives to renew the dialogue in keeping with a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2021 in Mexico City. In the memorandum, the two sides identified seven points for discussion, such as establishing electoral guarantees and an election calendar, lifting economic sanctions against Venezuela, respect for the constitutional rule of law, and political and social coexistence.  ■
