NEW DELHI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The cyclone Asani, which formed in the southeast Bay of Bengal intensified into a severe cyclonic storm and moved in the direction of north Andhra Pradesh-Odisha coasts, officials said Monday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the cyclone will not make landfall in Andhra Pradesh or Odisha and will weaken gradually during the next 24 hours. "It moved nearly west-northwestwards with a speed of 25 kmph during the past six hours and lay centered this morning over west central and adjoining south Bay of Bengal near latitude 14.0 degrees north and longitude 286.0 degrees east," a statement issued by the IMD said. "It is very likely to move northwestwards till May 10 and reach west central and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal off north Andhra Pradesh and Odisha coasts. Thereafter, it is very likely to recurve north northeastwards and move towards the northwest Bay of Bengal off Odisha coast." However, the IMD has predicted moderate to heavy rain in the coastal districts of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal from Tuesday evening until Thursday. The department said sea condition is likely to become high and rough and fishermen in these coastal areas have been advised against venturing into the sea and those on the sea have been asked to return immediately. Meanwhile, the local government in Odisha has decided to evacuate the people residing in mud houses located in the low-lying areas of at least 15 blocks of four coastal districts like Ganjam, Puri, Jagatsinghpur, and Kendrapada to safe shelters. Rescue teams from the disaster response force have been kept ready in places that are likely to be hit by heavy rains. The state has witnessed three cyclones in the past three years -- Fani in 2019, Amphan in 2020 and Yaas in 2021. Officials said the north coastal district of Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh has also been kept on high alert and a 24-hour working control room has been set up there to coordinate efforts.  ■
