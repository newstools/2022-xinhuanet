BERLIN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Production in Germany's industry in March fell by 3.9 percent compared to the previous month due to ongoing supply problems, according to preliminary figures published by the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) on Friday. The last time there had been a sharper decline was during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany in April 2020, when monthly production figures plummeted 18.1 percent, according to Destatis. Due to interrupted supply chains resulting from the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, many German companies were still facing problems completing their orders. 80 percent of companies currently had to deal with supply problems, according to a study by the ifo Institute. "Germany, as an export-oriented country, has been disproportionately affected by the trade sanctions against Russia," the Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) said in a statement. Important intermediate products had become scarce due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the ministry added, pointing to a 14 percent drop in automotive production in March due to a shortage of wiring harnesses. Energy production slumped 11.4 on the previous month, following a "marked increase" in February. According to Destatis, fluctuations were "mainly due to changes within energy production from wind power."  ■
