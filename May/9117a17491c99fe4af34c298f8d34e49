UNITED NATIONS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The killing of almost 100 civilians in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) last week raises concern over persistent insecurity in the area, a UN spokesman said on Tuesday. Stephane Dujarric, the chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said his humanitarian colleagues in the DRC voiced concern after a series of deadly raids, mainly on sites for displaced people. The attacks violate international humanitarian law. "Since early last week, close to 100 civilians have been killed in a series of attacks in the province of Ituri," Dujarric said. "Women and children were among the victims." He said more than 500 civilians reportedly were killed since the beginning of the year. At least 12 attacks on schools and hospitals also were reported. The spokesman said attacks in the past month displaced more than 165,000 people in Djugu Territory. Insecurity also affects humanitarian access, restricting the movement of humanitarian teams and delaying aid distribution.  ■
