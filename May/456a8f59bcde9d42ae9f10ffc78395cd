NEW DELHI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Local government in the eastern Indian state of Bihar has decided to grant permission for exploration of its gold reserve, an official said Sunday. The gold reserves, believed to be country's largest, are said to be in Jamui district, about 170 km southeast of Patna, the capital city of Bihar. "The state mines and geology department is in consultation with agencies engaged in exploration, including the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and the National Mineral Development Corporation, for tapping the gold reserves in Jamui," senior Bihar government official Harjot Kaur Bamhrah told media. "The consultation process started after an analysis of the GSI findings which indicated the presence of gold in areas such as Karmatia, Jhajha and Sono in Jamui district," Bamhrah said. She said the local government is likely to sign a memorandum of understanding with a central agency or agencies for G3 (preliminary) stage exploration within a month's time. Last year, federal mines minister Pralhad Joshi told the Indian parliament that Bihar holds the highest share of India's gold reserves.  ■
