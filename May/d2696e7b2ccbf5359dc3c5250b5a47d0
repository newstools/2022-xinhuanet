ADDIS ABABA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian security forces have arrested 76 suspects in connection with Eid al-Fitr festival violence in  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital. Ethiopia Security and Intelligence Task Force (ESITF) said in a press statement Monday that the suspects were accused of inciting a riot during Eid al-Fitr celebrations in Addis Ababa in the same day. "The ensuing riot injured a number of security forces and caused property damage in nearby buildings," the ESITF statement said. "76 individuals suspected of direct involvement in the riot have been apprehended, with a manhunt continuing for other suspects currently at large." The ESITF statement also said sharp blunt objects, foreign extremist memorabilia and violence-inciting flyers were seized along with the suspects. Tension has been rising across Ethiopia after deadly violence between the Christian and Muslim communities in the city of Gonder last week left at least 20 dead. The violence in Gonder was triggered by a longstanding competing ownership dispute of land surrounding a cemetery by members of both the Christian and Muslim communities. Ethiopian security forces have disclosed that 373 suspects have been arrested so far in connection with the deadly violence in Gonder city.  ■
