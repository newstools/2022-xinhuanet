MAPUTO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has strengthened the health protocol against COVID-19 at its main border crossings with South Africa due to the recent rise in infections in the neighboring country, the health authorities announced Tuesday. Health teams are positioned at the crossings to verify the results of COVID-19 tests and ensure compliance with the preventive measures among travelers entering Mozambique, said the Director of Health in Maputo Province Yolanda Santos who spoke to the press in Maputo, the Mozambican capital. Health units also reinforced surveillance, aiming to identify and control any respiratory diseases, said the director, whose province holds the largest crossing point with South Africa -- Ressano Garcia. Health Minister Armindo Tiago last week admitted the possibility of a considerable increase in COVID-19 cases in the country in the near future due to the deteriorated COVID situation in South Africa. Health authorities expect the new infections will be characterized by mild cases, given that 91.4 percent of the target population in the country have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Mozambique has 225,387 cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 2,201 deaths and 223,138 recoveries. It currently has 44 active cases of the novel coronavirus disease, and one hospitalized patient.  ■
