LOS ANGELES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- California's population shrank for the second consecutive year, bringing the Golden State's total to 39,185,605 as of Jan. 1, 2022, local authority announced Monday. The population of the California, which is still the most populous state in the United States, dipped slightly by 117,552 last year, according to a new population and housing data released from the California Department of Finance. The authority blamed the population loss on a declining birth rate coupled with an increase in deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic. "As Baby Boomers age, and fertility declines among younger cohorts, the continuing slowdown in natural increase -- births minus deaths -- underlies the plateauing of the state's population growth," the department said in a press release. "The addition of COVID-19-related deaths, federal policies restricting immigration, and an increase in domestic out-migration further affected population totals," it added. According to the latest data updated by the state on April 29, a total of 89,582 residents died of the COVID-19 infections.  ■
