WINDHOEK, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Namibia will raise the price of petrol by about 14 percent and that of diesel 7.5 percent next month, the government announced on Monday. The price of petrol at the pump in Walvis Bay will go up by 2.5 Namibia dollars (about 0.16 U.S. dollars) per liter to 20.40 Namibia dollars and the price of diesel will surge 1.5 Namibia dollars to hit 21.43 Namibia dollars a liter as of June 1, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) said, citing higher global oil prices. Fuel prices will be adjusted accordingly countrywide, MME Deputy Minister Kornelia Shilunga said. "The ministry is aware that the public is under a lot of financial pressures as far as the price is concerned," she said. "However, the public is reminded that Namibia is a price taker in the international oil market." "It is therefore important to understand that the government is only in control at the level of domestic levies, taxes and margins regarding the price of fuel," Shilunga said. "We will continue to keep an eye on the developments in the global oil market and continue to make decisions that are in the best interests of the Namibian fuel consumer," she said. Oil subsidy has become a heavy burden for the government's National Energy Fund, Shilunga said. Last month, Namibia announced a cut in tax levies on fuel for three months to help ease the pressure on consumers.  ■
