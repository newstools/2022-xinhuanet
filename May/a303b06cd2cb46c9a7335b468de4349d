KATHMANDU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nepal Army has halted all efforts to search a missing plane with 22 people on board due to "loss of daylight and adverse weather conditions," the army announced Sunday night. "The search will be resumed early in the morning tomorrow both from air and ground," Narayan Silwal, the army's spokesman, tweeted. The passenger plane under Nepal's Tara Air went missing in the morning when it was flying from Nepal's Pokhara to Jomsom in Mustang district.         "We are trying to reach the place where locals have allegedly seen something burning," Silwal tweeted hours ago. Six foreigners, including four Indians and two Germans, were among the 19 passengers on the plane.  ■
