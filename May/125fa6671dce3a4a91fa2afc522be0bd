Without providing details on the nature and types of projects, Balouch has urged Kabul residents to help the municipality implement all the projects as per schedule on time. Thousands of people would find jobs from the projects, the mayor added. Afghanistan's capital Kabul with a population of nearly 6 million has been facing a variety of problems ranging from a shortage of drinking water, energy, sewerage, poor transport system and health services.  ■
