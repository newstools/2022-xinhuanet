COPENHAGEN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Twice as many men have died from COVID-19 in Denmark than women, Statistics Denmark said on Wednesday. A study of 3,550 Danish citizens who died from COVID-19 between March 2020, when the coronavirus first appeared in Denmark, and the end of 2021 revealed that the mortality rate, and in particular the gender distribution, was unequal across demographic groups. While the overall mortality rate was 61 deaths per 100,000 citizens, the "age adjusted" rate was 46 out of 100,000 women and just over 81 out of 100,000 men. "The higher mortality rate among men can be due to many different factors, such as lifestyle, but these are not contexts we have investigated," said Anne Vinkel Hansen, data scientist at Statistics Denmark. Analysis has also revealed that the mortality rate among unemployed people was three times higher than among those in employment. The mortality rate among the highly educated was also significantly lower than among those with a lower level of education. The age-adjusted mortality rate was 197 per 100,000 among immigrants with non-Western backgrounds, most of whom belonged to low-income households. The Statens Serum Institut (SSI), Denmark's public health institute, said that as of May 2, that country had registered a cumulative total of 3,119,099 COVID-19 cases and 6,191 deaths.  ■
