JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, rose to 3.47 percent year on year in April, the highest since August 2019, the Statistics Indonesia (BPS) said on Monday. "The main contributor to inflation in April is the increase in commodity prices of cooking oil, gasoline, meat, flight fares, and fresh fish," Head of BPS Margo Yuwono said at a press conference. On a monthly basis, this Southeast Asian country recorded inflation of 0.95 percent month on month, the highest since January 2017 which registered 0.97 percent. This figure is slightly different from the central bank's forecast, but is still within the safe limit set by the central bank of 2 to 4 percent.  ■
