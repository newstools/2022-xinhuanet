BANJUL, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Gambian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Monday that 12 Gambians have been released from Libyan prisons following the end of their jail terms and are awaiting repatriation. The Gambian nationals who had already served a one-year jail term will be repatriated on the next available charter flight through the International Organization for Migration's Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR) programme, the ministry said in a statement. Libya has been the main passage route for Gambian migrants who intend to cross the Mediterranean Sea to get to Europe, but some migrants suffer arbitrary arrests, torture, illegal imprisonment and other challenges in the process.  ■
