OTTAWA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Racialized Canadians aged 25 to 64 years were about half as likely as the rest of the population to hold senior management positions, Statistics Canada revealed on Tuesday. The new data shed light on the unique experiences of racialized Canadians, whether they immigrated to Canada or were born in the country, the national statistical office said, using data from the 2006 and 2016 censuses, the 2011 National Household Survey, and the 2020 General Social Survey on Social Identity. According to the agency, in 2016, 15 workers per 1,000 who were part of the rest of the population were in a senior management position, compared with 7 workers per 1,000 of racialized groups. Within the racialized population, there were differences between immigrants and non-immigrants in the same age group, where 9 non-immigrants per 1,000 held senior management positions, compared with 7 immigrants per 1,000 in 2016. The representation in senior management positions also varied by gender. In the 25 to 64 age group, men were twice as likely to be in senior management positions compared to women in both the racialized population and the rest of the population. Full inclusion and participation in various social, political and economic institutions requires that everyone has the opportunity to progress within society and eventually reach management positions associated with decision-making functions in public administration, institutions and businesses, the agency said, adding that these indicators provide valuable information to develop policies to combat racism and discrimination.  ■
