YANGON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Ten ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) in Myanmar had accepted the invitation to attend the peace talks initiated by State Administration Council's (SAC) chairman Senior General Min Aung Hlaing last month, the council's spokesperson Zaw Min Tun said on Tuesday. "We so far received the registration of seven EAOs that are signatories to Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) and three non-signatory EAOs for the peace talks," Zaw Min Tun said. The seven NCA-signatory EAOs registered for the peace talks are Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), the KNU/KNLA Peace Council, Pa-Oh National Liberation Organization (PNLO), New Mon State Party (NMSP), Arakan Liberation Party (ALP), Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army (RCSS/SSA) and the Lahu Democratic Union (LDU), Zaw Min Tun said. The three NCA non-signatory EAOs registered for the peace talks are United Wa State Army (UWSA), National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA-Mongla) and Shan State Progressive Party (SSPP), he added. The date of the peace talks would be set in giving priority to the convenient time of the registered EAOs, Zaw Min Tun said, adding that the SAC intended to have the peace talks take place as soon as possible. Zaw Min Tun also said the SAC had designated 2022 as the year of peace, and it is a good time for peace. In Myanmar, 10 ethnic armed groups so far signed the national ceasefire agreement with the government since it was initiated in October 2015. Some EAOs including the Karen National Union (KNU), the Chin National Front (CNF) and the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) said in statements that they would not attend the peace talks invited by SAC chairman Min Aung Hlaing. The state power of Myanmar was transferred to Commander-in-Chief of Defense Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing after the declaration of the state of emergency in February last year.  ■
