SUVA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Tourism Fiji has launched its Corporate Plan 2022-2024, setting a clear direction for the industry and its partners over the next few years to earn more money for the country. Tourism Fiji Chair Andre Viljoen said Tuesday that the plan is a roadmap to take the industry towards the overarching target of reaching visitor expenditure of 3 billion Fijian dollars (around 1.4 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of 2024, reported by Fiji Broadcasting Corporation (FBC) on Tuesday. Viljoen said while the global pandemic might have knocked the tourism industry off, it is now on the road to recovery. "The Tourism Fiji corporate plan is a comprehensive document that clearly outlines Tourism Fiji's strategic priorities and will guide our organization over the next two years. It will prompt us to work more focused, more sustainably to channel our resources towards the right goals." Tourism Fiji Chief Executive Brent Hill said their target is to return the industry to pre-COVID levels in terms of its contribution to the economy. Fiji has received more than 119,000 international tourists since the island nation reopened its borders in December last year. Fiji received over 46,000 visitors in April, bringing the total arrivals this year to more than 95,000. Fiji is expected to receive 447,000 tourists this year.  ■
