BANJUL, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Gambian President Adama Barrow warned against corruption on Tuesday, asking government officials to work towards making the country a model for public service delivery. Barrow made the remarks at a swearing-in ceremony of new Vice President Badara Joof and cabinet ministers at State House in Banjul. "I assure the incoming Cabinet of my support, but we must take a zero-tolerance stance on corruption. We are responsible for the state resources in our custody, and should not be found wanting," said Barrow, adding that strict measures will be taken to implement the anti-corruption law. Public servants and ministers must brace up for proper delivery of services with high-level accountability and transparency, the president noted. The swearing-in of cabinet ministers came five months after Barrow was re-elected as Gambian president in December.  ■
