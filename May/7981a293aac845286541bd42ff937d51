DENVER, the United States, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A coalition of politicians, businesses, and local communities in the western U.S. state of Colorado has been working to reduce light pollution to create one of the world's largest International Dark Sky Reserves. "The main purpose is to mitigate light pollution -- making sure that light is pointed downwards instead of emanating into the sky," Danielle Robben of San Luis Valley Great Outdoors (SLVGO) told National Public Radio (NPR). "The lighting management plan doesn't actually require cities and counties to change out all their lighting or to turn their lighting off," she said, noting that the effort needs to get 80 percent of the targeted area to adopt Dark Sky compliant lighting. On SLVGO's Facebook Page, members posted pictures of the night sky, particularly the Milky Way galaxy, to raise people's awareness of light pollution and air pollution. "It really feels like you're standing on the edge of the universe," SLVGO executive director Mick Daniel told NPR. "I don't even know how to describe it to people until they get to stand here and experience the Milky Way," he added. "It's just really phenomenal and we've got to protect it." The coalition aims to submit an application to the International Dark Sky Association for being recognized as the world's largest International Dark Sky Reserve covering over 10,800 square kilometers by the end of the year. The proposed reserve would cover land filled by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which stretch from Poncha Pass in south-central Colorado to Glorieta Pass in north-central New Mexico, containing 10 peaks over 14,000 feet (4,267 meters) high and two dozen more over 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) in elevation, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.  ■
