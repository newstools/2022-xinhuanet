DAKAR, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The 14th Dakar Biennale of African Contemporary Art kicked off Thursday in Dakar, the capital of Senegal, with China invited to participate in the biennale as a guest country of honor for the first time. This year's Dakar Biennale, with the theme of "Forging: out of fire", showcases artworks from 28 countries around the world. The opening ceremony was held at the National Theatre of Senegal. Senegalese President Macky Sall attended the opening ceremony and visited the exhibition in the China Pavilion accompanied by Xiao Han, Chinese Ambassador to Senegal. During the opening ceremony, Sall said that China is a great civilization that's thousands of years old, and her cultural spirit is reflected by the many beautiful and ingenious artworks. He added that Chinese creators have successfully integrated the talent, culture as well as the tradition of the Chinese people through art, which is admirable. Xiao Han said it was the first time that the exhibition has invited a non-African country as the guest of honor, which fully reflects the great importance that the Senegalese and African art circles attach to Chinese contemporary art, and shows the vigor of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Africa. Yue Jieqiong, the curator of the China Pavillon, said that they have selected 24 works of 12 Chinese artists, including paintings, sculptures, videos and others, based on the concept of "transition and active energy". The Dakar Biennale of African Contemporary Art, which was founded in 1992, is a most influential contemporary art event in sub-Saharan Africa. The exhibition will last until June 21.  ■
