LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The recent mass shooting in the United States "marked an alarming convergence of racist extremism, gun violence and the radicalizing effects of social media," British newspaper The Guardian has reported. The incident shook a nation that "can sometimes seem numbed to atrocities," said the report published on Wednesday. Police have said they are investigating a 180-page manifesto the shooting suspect was believed to have written, outlining the "great replacement" theory, which baselessly claims white people are being intentionally overrun by other races, the report said. According to the report, U.S. President Joe Biden attacked those who promote racist conspiracy theory "for power, political gain and for profit." Biden condemned those who spread white supremacist lies during a visit to Buffalo, New York, where 10 people were killed in a racist shooting last Saturday.  ■
