SEOUL, May 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea posted the lowest first-quarter fertility rate due to the record-low childbirths, statistical office data showed Wednesday. The total fertility rate, which gauges the average number of babies that a woman is expected to have during her lifetime, stood at 0.86 in the January-March quarter, according to Statistics Korea. It marked the lowest first-quarter figure. The rate hovered below 1 for the 12th consecutive quarter since the second quarter of 2019. The number of newborn babies came in at 68,177 in the first quarter, down 2.8 percent from a year earlier. It marked the lowest first-quarter number. Childbirths have been on the decline amid the continued social trend of delayed marriage and the lower number of women who are at childbearing age. The number of marriages came to 45,377 in the first quarter, down 5.5 percent from a year earlier. The number of divorces declined 11.2 percent to 2,825 in the cited quarter. The low birth rate boosted concerns about the demographic cliff, which refers to a drop in the heads of households eventually leading to a consumption cliff. The number of deaths increased 33.2 percent over the year to 103,363 in the first quarter owing to the rapid spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant. It was the highest quarterly deaths.  ■
