NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The prevailing heatwave in India particularly in the north, west and central parts, might lead to a curb in the yield of wheat crops, besides contributing to inflation and adversely affecting the overall growth, the Moody's rating agency said in a report on Sunday. Notably, the major wheat-growing states in India are Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and parts of Uttar Pradesh. Over the past couple of weeks, mercury in these states has risen to over 45 degrees Celsius, thus throwing normal life out of gear as people keep themselves indoors, particularly during the daytime. Due to the prevailing heatwave in north and western states, the estimates of wheat production in the current season have fallen by over 5 percent. The federal government had recently decided to curb wheat exports considering the possible fall in wheat production this season. The report stated that the prolonged elevated temperatures affecting much of the northwestern India will curb wheat production and could lead to extended power outages, which may exacerbate already high inflation and hurt growth of the country. "Over the longer term, India's highly negative credit exposure to physical climate risks means its economic growth will likely become more volatile as it faces increasing, and more extreme, incidences of climate-related shocks," it added. Moody's further stated that inflation in India will be partially alleviated by keeping wheat production for domestic consumption and the cap on power prices in exchanges, as well as the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) 40-basis point policy rate rise in early May. "However, given the prominence of cereals and food more generally in India's consumption, elevated food prices could add to social risks if they persist," it added.  ■
