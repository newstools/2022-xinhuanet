DUBLIN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The average prices of goods and services in Ireland, as measured by consumer price index (CPI), were 7 percent higher in April when compared with a year ago, said the country's Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Thursday. This is the largest annual CPI increase since November 2000 when the annual inflation rate in the country also stood at 7 percent, said the CSO. In April, the largest annual increases in prices were recorded in the transport sector (up 18.9 percent) and the sector of housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels (up 17.1 percent), it said. In response to the rising cost of living, the Irish government has taken a number of measures including reducing fuel taxes and providing subsidies for household electricity and gas bills.  ■
