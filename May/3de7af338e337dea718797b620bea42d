ADDIS ABABA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Huawei Ethiopia has held a forum that is aimed at linking new university graduates into Ethiopia's information communications technology sector. The two-day Huawei Ethiopia forum, the second of the kind, was organized in collaboration with Addis Ababa University and ran until Tuesday, with the purpose of promoting jobs to newly graduating students. The forum coincided with Addis Ababa University's annual Research and Job Fairs Week which began Monday. Tamire Dawud, the manager for ICT Ecosystem Development at Huawei Technologies Ethiopia Plc, said the forum is part of Huawei's continued commitment to train and certify new graduates and equip them with the latest trends in the industry including data communication, artificial intelligence, big data, wireless LAN. "Huawei, as a leading global provider of information and communications technology infrastructure and smart devices, offers training on the latest technologies, eventually creating job opportunities for the trained youth," Dawud said. Noting Huawei's special internships trend that gives a chance to new graduates to join an internship program at its Ethiopian head office, Dawud said new graduates will acquire work experience and familiarize themselves with the work environment, among others. Huawei Ethiopian head office last year offered internship opportunities to more than 250 new graduates and hired more than 200 interns. The company planned to accept up to 300 new graduates this year, according to  Dawud. Dawud said that the forum offers a unique opportunity for students who would have otherwise encountered various difficulties in order to get the rare internationally acclaimed training as well as job opportunities. Huawei, which works in collaboration with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education, has opened an ICT academy across 42 higher education institutions in Ethiopia.  ■
