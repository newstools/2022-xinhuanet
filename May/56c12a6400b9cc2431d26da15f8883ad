LAGOS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian army said Saturday two gunmen from the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN), were killed in a shootout on Friday in the southern state of Imo. In a statement, Onyema Nwachukwu, the army spokesperson, said army troops dislodged the gunmen from their training camp at a village in the Orlu local government area of the state, before killing them during a gun battle. Nwachukwu said the training camp belongs to the proscribed group, and was responsible for "various acts of criminality and violence" in some southern states. According to him, the troops also destroyed the training shed and other facilities used by the separatists, including a shrine and a weapon factory. Nigeria, the most populous African country, has in recent months been troubled by a series of security incidents, including kidnappings, banditry and extremist attacks.  ■
