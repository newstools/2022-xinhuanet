KATHMANDU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- With the last dead body found on Tuesday morning, all the 22 bodies left by a crashed Nepali passenger plane have been recovered, the Nepal Army said. "Last dead body has been recovered. Arranging to bring remaining 12 dead bodies from crash site to Kathmandu," tweeted Brigadier General Narayan Silwal, spokesman of the Nepal Army, which was leading the search and rescue effort. A preliminary study shows bad weather conditions caused the Twin Otter plane to crash in a remote hilly area in Nepal's Mustang district, but the details will be probed by a five-member investigation team, Deo Chandra Lal Karn, spokesman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, told Xinhua. The Tara Air plane went missing on Sunday morning minutes after it took off from the Nepali city of Pokhara on a journey to Jomsom in Mustang district. Nineteen passengers, including 13 Nepalis, four Indians and two Germans, were aboard the flight along with three crew members. The Nepal Army found the crash site on Monday morning with 21 bodies recovered and 10 airlifted to Kathmandu on the day.  ■
