KIGALI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The remains of more than 9,000 victims of the 1994 Rwanda genocide against the Tutsi were given a befitting burial earlier this week at the Nyanza Genocide Memorial site in Kicukiro district in the capacity of Kigali. The remains were recently retrieved from mass graves in different parts of Kigali following information volunteered on their whereabouts by some perpetrators. "It is quite unfortunate to see that decades after the genocide, we are still retrieving the remains of genocide victims and giving them decent burial," Paulin Rugero, an official of Ibuka, the umbrella association of Rwanda genocide survivors. Jean-Damascene Bizimana, Rwanda's National Unity and Civic Engagements Minister castigated genocide perpetrators for withholding information about mass graves. Florence Mukantaganda, a survivor whose family, including her husband, were killed in the genocide appealed to people with any information leading to mass graves to come forward and inform local leaders within their respective communities in order for all genocide victims' remains to get befitting burial. The burial ceremony on Thursday was attended by several residents, government officials and families of the victims as part of the 100 days of commemoration which started on April 7. This year marks the 28th anniversary of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi, in which more than one million people, mainly ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus, were killed.  ■
