PHNOM PENH, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen said here on Tuesday that he has decided to change his official date of birth to the true date when he was born. Speaking at a meeting with a group of anti-COVID-19 volunteer doctors, Hun Sen said his current official birth date was April 4, 1951, but his actual birth date was August 5, 1952, which was in a zodiac year of the dragon. He said an administrative error was to blame for his using a wrong date of birth for several decades. "I have discussed with Justice Minister Koeut Rith already and I will return to use my actual birth date," he said. He added that when the process of changing his date of birth is completed, he will announce it to the public and notify it to friendly countries in a diplomatic note.  ■
