SYDNEY, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Authorities of the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) is urging people to get vaccinated ahead of the flu season, as influenza cases have more than doubled in recent weeks. The latest NSW respiratory surveillance report issued on Thursday showed there were 1,024 new influenza cases in the week ending April 30, compared with 478 cases in the previous week. The proportion positive has increased from 3.1 percent to 5.5 percent. "Alongside the increase in flu cases, we are seeing more people with flu presenting to and being admitted to hospital, including among young children," said NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant. Chant noted young children should be particularly cautious, as many children have had little or no exposure to flu over the last two years due to the COVID-19 public health measures. "We strongly encourage parents of children aged between six months and five years old to get them vaccinated without delay." Meanwhile, the health authorities added the flu is circulating widely in the community, coinciding with ongoing high levels of transmission of COVID-19. Residents were told it is safe and convenient to get both the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine at the same time.  ■
