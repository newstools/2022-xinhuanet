KATHMANDU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- British climber Kenton Cool on Sunday broke his own record by scaling the world's highest Mt. Qomolangma for the 16th time, the most ever by a non-Nepali mountaineer, said the company organizing his expedition. "Cool and two other foreign climbers and five Nepali Sherpa guides reached the top of Mt. Qomolangma at 05:25 a.m. on Sunday," Iswari Poudel, general manager of Himalayan Guides Nepal, told Xinhua. "By reaching the top of the mountain, he broke his own record of most summits of the world's tallest peak by any foreign national," Poudel added. The latest success gave Cool, 48, a lead over U.S. climber David Allen Hahn, who has summited Mt. Qomolangma 15 times. "This marks KC's (Kenton Cool) 16th summit, a non Sherpa record," Cool wrote in his social media account. The British became the first mountaineer to climb Mt. Qomolangma (8,848.86m), the world's fourth tallest Mt. Lhotse (8,516m) and Mt. Nuptse (7,861m), in a single season in 2013. On May 7, Kami Rita Sherpa, a well-known Nepali mountain guide, set a world record by scaling Mt. Qomolangma for the 26th time.  ■
