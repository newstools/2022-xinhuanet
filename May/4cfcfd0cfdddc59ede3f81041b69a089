PHNOM PENH, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in Cambodia began a two-week campaign  on Saturday for the fifth commune elections, which will be held on June 5, a National Election Committee (NEC) official said. Seventeen political parties have contested in the upcoming elections, with the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the opposition Candlelight Party being the major contestants. The campaign started from May 21 to June 3 on a daily basis from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time, NEC member Em Sophat said, adding that it is a series of actions that will persuade voters to cast their ballots for a candidate or a political party. "During the campaign, political party supporters can hold public rallies, march in parades, conduct door to door campaigns, and distribute their political parties' promotional materials," he said. Sophat also called on all political parties and supporters to abide by the rules, regulations and principles set out in the Law on the Election of Commune Council in order to ensure a safe and peaceful campaign. The elections are to elect commune chiefs and councilors for the country's 1,652 communes, the NEC said, adding that about 9.2 million eligible voters, or 87.9 percent of the total population of 18 years and above, are expected to cast their ballots. Held once every five years, the commune elections are seen as a bellwether of the party's support ahead of the general elections in 2023. In the last commune elections in June 2017, the ruling CPP won 1,156 communes.  ■
