PARIS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in France, excluding the overseas territory of Mayotte, was virtually stable at 7.3 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) said Tuesday. According to the INSEE, the number of unemployed people reached 2.2 million, decreasing by 18,000 over the quarter, while the unemployment rate dropped by 0.8 percentage points year on year. During the first quarter, for people aged 15 to 24 the unemployment rate was at 16.3 percent, for people aged 25 to 49 at 6.6 percent, and for aged 50 or more at 5.6 percent, noted the institute. The long-term unemployment rate was stable with 700,000 jobless people declaring that they have been job-seeking for at least one year, the INSEE said. It also pointed out that the high number of non-working days due to sick leave because of the health crisis (Delta and Omicron waves of COVID-19) lowered the average number of working hours.  ■
