TUNIS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Kais Saied announced on Thursday that preparations are underway to draft a new constitution, which will be submitted to a referendum slated for July 25. Saied told a council of ministers meeting that "the new constitution will reflect Tunisians' will," according to a statement released by the Tunisian Presidency. The new republic, which will be founded on a new constitution, will maintain the country's unity and continuity, and safeguard Tunisians' rights to a dignified life, said the Tunisian president. Saied declared in December last year that a constitutional referendum would be held in July of this year, followed by parliamentary elections at the end of 2022.  ■
