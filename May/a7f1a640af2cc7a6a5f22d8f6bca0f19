LAGOS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Lecturers in public universities across Nigeria have extended their ongoing strike by 12 weeks, the president of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Emmanuel Osodeke, said on Monday. The decision was to "give the government enough time" to resolve all outstanding issues with the lecturers, the ASUU, the umbrella body of the country's university teachers, said in a statement, urging the government to speedily address all the issues raised in an agreement with the ASUU in 2020. The ASUU started the nationwide warning strike in February, demanding, among others, the renegotiation of welfare, government's funding of the revitalization of public universities, earned academic allowances and promotion arrears. Talks between the government and the ASUU have not resulted in and end to the industrial action by the lecturers.  ■
