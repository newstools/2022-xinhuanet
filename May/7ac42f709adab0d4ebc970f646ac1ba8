SYDNEY, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Health authorities of Australia's state of New South Wales (NSW) issued a health alert on Thursday after five people in Sydney were found to be infected with Legionnaires' disease. The five people, two women and three men ranging in age from their 40s to 70s, were confirmed with the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease. They were all admitted to hospital for the treatment of pneumonia. The cases visited several places across Sydney CBD. The state health department advised people who have been in the Sydney CBD area in the past 10 days to watch out for symptoms including fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath. Legionnaires' disease is often associated with contaminated cooling towers of large buildings. People can be exposed to the bacteria if contaminated water particles from the cooling system are emitted into the air and breathed in. Symptoms of the disease can develop up to 10 days from the time of exposure to contaminated water particles in the air and may lead to severe chest infections such as pneumonia. NSW Health said the disease cannot be spread from person to person. It can be diagnosed by chest x-ray and a urine test and usually requires antibiotic treatment in the hospital. NSW Health environmental health officers are working with the City of Sydney to review testing and maintenance records of all cooling towers in the CBD area to prioritize inspection and sampling of potential source towers. Before the five cases, a number of cases have been identified recently throughout Sydney. Public health units across NSW are also following up on every case and work with local councils in the management of cooling towers in buildings.  ■
