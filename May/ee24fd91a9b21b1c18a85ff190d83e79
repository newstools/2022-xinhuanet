KATHMANDU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The so-called Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is nothing but "an American ploy" to aggrandize its own "hegemonic adventurism" in the region, a Nepali scholar has said. Sunder Nath Bhattarai, officiating chairman of the China Study Center in Nepal, described the economic framework launched on Monday during U.S. President Joe Biden's trip to Japan as his attempt to give an economic face to the so-called Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad). "There is no doubt that the Quad involving Japan, India, Australia and the United States is primarily aimed at countering China's rise, which the United States sees as a grave threat to its post-World War II supranational hegemonic global supremacy," Bhattarai told Xinhua on Tuesday. Moreover, the U.S.-led economic initiative "in essence is taken by many as an American ploy to create an organization working solely under its tacit supervision and control and concentrated to aggrandize its own hegemonic adventurism in the Indo-Pacific region, with no substantive benefits to participating countries," he said. In addition, "partisan characters and problems" of its members may give rise to various controversies within the framework, the scholar noted. In his view, China's supply chain capability, both in terms of quantity and quality, is wider and more robust than that of Japan, Australia or India. "I do not think that in view of China's great innovative technological progress made by it and the genuine leadership roles it has been playing in solving severe global problems, which are engulfing the world at present, efforts to check China's rise could so easily be an achievable goal for the United States or any other outside forces," he said.  ■
