KHARTOUM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Sudan on Sunday condemned what it called a terrorist attack that killed 11 Egyptian soldiers on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal. "Sudan expresses its strong condemnation of the terrorist incident which killed a number of soldiers in the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt," Sudan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The ministry also expressed solidarity with Egypt and its full support for Egypt's unremitting efforts in combating terrorism. Such "cowardly acts" would not break the will of the Egyptian government and people to maintain security and stability in the country, said the statement. The Egyptian army said at least 11 Egyptian soldiers were killed and five others wounded on Saturday in clashes with a group of terrorists at a water pumping station in western Sinai.  ■
