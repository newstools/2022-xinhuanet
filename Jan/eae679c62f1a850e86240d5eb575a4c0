ZAGREB, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- In the previous seven days, Croatia has recorded over 48,600 new COVID-19 cases, the highest weekly caseload since the outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020, Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said at a government session here on Thursday. This is double the number two weeks ago, Plenkovic said. The country has also reported more than 13,000 COVID-19-related deaths since the pandemic began. Plenkovic urged his compatriots to get vaccinated, emphasizing that the authorities have enough vaccine doses for everyone. On Thursday, Croatia reported 9,157 new COVID-19 infections, the second highest caseload since Feb. 25, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was identified in the country, and 23 coronavirus-related deaths. On Thursday, the cumulative number of confirmed infections stood at 794,190 and the death toll at 13,006 across the country. The low vaccination rate -- 56 percent -- has widely been blamed for the high infection rate in the country.  ■
