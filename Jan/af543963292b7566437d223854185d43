LJUBLJANA, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Slovenian Parliament Speaker Igor Zorcic had tested positive for coronavirus and was in self-isolation, the parliament said on Friday, while Defense Minister Matej Tonin said on Twitter he had also tested positive. Zorcic tested positive on Thursday and was among the 9,858 infections confirmed in Slovenia that day. On Friday, Tonin tweeted that coronavirus had found him. "I am positive. Currently without any symptoms. Vaccination works. Take care of yourselves, stay healthy," he said. Currently, there are 96,481 active cases in the country, meaning nearly 5 percent of the population is infected, according to data released by the country's National Institute of Public Health on Friday. The self-isolation time will be cut from at least ten to seven days in Slovenia starting from Monday, health officials said on Friday. This will apply to most of the infected people, provided they will not have fever or any other symptoms 24 hours before ending self-isolation with a negative test result. Slovenia has been badly hit by COVID-19, but only 57.4 percent of its population of 2.1 million has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Therefore, the government is calling on citizens to get vaccinated.  ■
