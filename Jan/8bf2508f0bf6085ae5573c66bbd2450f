LJUBLJANA, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia reported 13,911 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, the third daily record this week, the National Institute of Public Health reported on Sunday. The institute estimates that the number of total active COVID-19 cases in the country, which has a population of 2.1 million, is 112,517. Since the country is unable to process the large number of tests on a daily basis, Slovenia on Wednesday started to send a part of test samples to a laboratory in Germany, the National Laboratory for Health, Environment and Food said on Thursday. The results are usually available next day. Slovenia will from Monday shorten the obligatory self-isolation for patients whose COVID-19 symptoms have disappeared and tested negative on the 7th day of the illness from 10 to seven days, the government said on Friday. So far, about 57.5 percent of the country's population has been fully vaccinated.  ■
