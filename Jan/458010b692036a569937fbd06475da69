(Xinhua/Javed Dar) SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- Police in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir Friday said three militants were killed in a gunfight in the region. According to the police, the gunfight broke out at village Chadoora of Budgam district, about 30 km south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir. "Last night contingents of police, paramilitary and army cordoned off Zolwa Kralpora locality of Chadoora here. The moment they reach the suspected area, militants fired upon them triggering a gunfight. In exchange of the fire that continued until this morning three militants were killed," a police official said. The operation was launched on a specific intelligence suggesting the presence of the militants, according to the police. The police said the government forces have not suffered any damage during their fight with the holed-up militants, adding that the identity of the slain militants was being ascertained. There has been a surge in the gunfights in the region over the past two weeks. Friday's killings have taken the death toll of militants to 10 in gunfights during the past four days. A guerilla war has been going on between militants and Indian troops stationed in the region since 1989. However, of late Indian policemen too have been trained to fight them. Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan, is claimed by both in full. Since their independence from Britain, the two countries have fought three wars, two exclusively over Kashmir. ■
