NEW YORK, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration has inconsistent messaging on its COVID-19 response, creating a "real problem," Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, has said. "We have different agencies that have not been on the same page," Jha said during an appearance on Fox News' "Fox News Sunday." "And I think that part has been a real problem," Jha said. The former Donald Trump administration "cared little about accuracy and often spread misinformation," he said, adding the "Biden team needs to work on consistency." The White House, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health have sometimes had different messaging during the Biden administration, said Jha. "I think the White House needs to get its messaging discipline together, needs to make sure that people are speaking from the same page," he said. "My sense is that that has not been happening consistently. And it would be enormously helpful to the American people if that messaging was more consistent," Jha said.  ■
