DAR ES SALAAM, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's wildlife authorities announced on Saturday the auctioning of 75 tourist hunting blocks in 2022. The Tanzania Wildlife Management Authority (TAWA) said in a statement that the tourist hunting blocks will be auctioned in game controlled areas, open areas and game reserves. The TAWA said in the statement that the auctioning that will take seven days will start on Jan. 12. The statement said eligible hunting companies can be allocated up to five hunting blocks each, which shall be of different categories. In Feb. 2021, the TAWA said 10 firms had applied to operate 10 tourist hunting blocks through electronic auctioning. Imani Nkuwi, TAWA deputy commissioner for tourism and business services, had told Xinhua that initially the TAWA had announced 30 vacant hunting blocks but the number was reduced to 10. In March 2020, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism postponed the electronic auctioning of the vacant hunting blocks. The decision was made due to market instability caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ■
