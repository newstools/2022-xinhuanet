BEIJING, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- It's not a smooth journey for Russian speed skating athlete Olga Fatkulina to attend the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games, but she never gives in. She suffered torn back muscle during a warm-up at the European Championships, and missed the competition in January 2021. Then she got COVID-19 virus, however, has recovered from it recently to meet Beijing Olympic Games on time. After this Saturday's training, she said, "I have antibodies and I'm very confident." Fatkulina had some injuries after she got silver medal in women's 500m at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, like knee ligament injury after a fall in 2015, thigh muscle tear in 2016. But all there didn't beat her. Fatkulina started speed skating at nine and this sport has given her strength, no matter facing her mother's premature death or economic difficulties. At the end of 2021, she got a bronze medal in women's 1,000m at Calgary World Cup. "I wanted to show my ability to get good place at Beijing 2022 and I want to give a new motivation for young Russian skaters," Fatkulina said. As for the venue and services, Fatkulina said, "I'm very impressed by the 'Ice Ribbon'. I think it's very bright and very big. And I like readiness and enthusiasm of all of these volunteers." Chinese athletes' endeavour also impressed her. "I see one or two good Chinese athletes in speed skating several years ago, but now, in this Olympics there are more and more good athletes and there might be more good results from the Chinese team."  ■
