DAR ES SALAAM, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan on Saturday launched the first ever cultural festival for northern regions of Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Manyara and Tanga, and called for protection of the country's culture, tradition and arts. Launching the cultural festival, Hassan said the cultural festivals will help instill "culture, tradition and arts to the young generation." The festival attracted three major tribes from Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Manyara and Tanga regions and traditional foods and traditional dances were exhibited. Hassan urged other regions in the country to follow suit. "Our young generation should inherit our culture and traditions, and these cultural festivals should act as bridges for the young generation to take over," said Hassan. "Tanzania should be proud of its culture and traditions that are nurtured by the country's 120 tribes," she said, adding these cultures and traditions are playing a major role in uniting people. Hassan urged the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Sports to invite diplomats accredited to Tanzania to the national cultural festival to be held in May 2022, saying the diplomats will help promote the country's culture in their respective countries. She pledged to increase budget for the ministry to enable it to protect and promote the country's culture and traditions.  ■
