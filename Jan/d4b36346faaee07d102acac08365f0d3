SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Police in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir said on Saturday that a militant was killed in a gunfight with government forces in the region. The gunfight, according to the police, broke out at village Kilbal in Shopian district, about 55 km south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir. "Today contingents of police, paramilitary and army cordoned off Kilbal village here. The moment they reach the suspected area, militants fired upon them triggering a gunfight. In the exchange of the fire a militant was killed," a police official said. "The operation is underway in the area." The operation was launched on a specific intelligence suggesting the presence of militants. Police said the government forces have not suffered any damage during their fight with the holed-up militants. A guerrilla war is going on between militants and Indian troops stationed in the region since 1989. However, of late Indian policemen too have been trained to fight them. The gunfight between the two sides takes place intermittently across the region. Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan, is claimed by both in full. Since their independence from Britain, the two countries have fought three wars, two exclusively over Kashmir.  ■
