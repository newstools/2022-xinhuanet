MUMBAI, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indian quality standard regulator Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) said Monday that it has confiscated a huge number of uncertified toys from the Hamleys store in Mumbai. The Hamleys store, owned and operated by Reliance Brands Ltd, was found selling electronic and non-electronic toys without the BIS Standard Mark, violating the quality control orders on toys issued by the Indian government. The move marked the second such raid by the regulator which confiscated uncertified toys from an outlet of the international wholesaler Metro Cash and Carry in Mumbai on Sunday. In India, violation of government quality standard regulations is punishable for imprisonment up to two years or a minimum of 2,696 U.S. dollars in fine or both according to the law. India has notified that all toys sold in the country shall mandatorily be certified by the BIS for their safety and shall bear the BIS standard mark on them.  ■
