JAKARTA, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia on Friday confirmed 2,604 new COVID-19 cases, the highest single-day rise since Sept. 24, 2021, amid the spread of the Omicron variant in the archipelago. With the newly reported cases, the total tally of infections rose to 4,280,248, the health ministry said. The ministry's senior official Siti Nadia Tarmizi said on Friday that the total number of confirmed Omicron cases nationwide has risen to 1,078. Among the new Omicron cases, 756 are imported cases, and 257 are local transmissions, while health authorities are still identifying sources of the remaining 65 cases, she said. In the past 24 hours, the death toll from COVID-19 in Indonesia rose to 144,201 including two new deaths, while 811 more people recovered from the disease, bringing the total number of recoveries to 4,121,928. Hundreds of patients infected with the Omicron variant are currently under medical treatment in the Wisma Atlet Kemayoran emergency hospital for COVID-19 patients in the capital Jakarta, Tarmizi said, adding that authorities have allowed Omicron patients to conduct self-isolation independently. As the Indonesian government is accelerating national vaccination programs to curb the spread of the coronavirus, more than 180.02 million people in the Southeast Asian country have received their first dose, while over 123.16 million have taken their second dose. Indonesia started mass COVID-19 vaccinations in January last year after the authorities approved the emergency use of China's Sinovac vaccine. Aiming to fully vaccinate 208.26 million people in the country, the Indonesian government has administered over 304.97 million doses, including the third booster jabs.  ■
