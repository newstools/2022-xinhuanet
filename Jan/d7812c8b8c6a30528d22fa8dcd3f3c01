DUBAI, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Washington should work with the world to uphold global unity rather than reverting to a new Cold War, according to an op-ed piece posted on the website of the Gulf News, an English newspaper in the United Arab Emirates. The so-called U.S. diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, intended to exert pressure on China, might be considered politically motivated, according to the article, noting that only three other countries have agreed to join the U.S. stunt. "Tellingly, and ironically, the same three countries... actively participated in America's military misadventures," the article said. The article urged Washington to keep in mind existing global divisions and the need for international unity to tackle collective crises, such as environmental crises and deadly pandemics, rather than reverting to a new Cold War, which would serve no purpose other than to harm millions of people around the world.  ■
