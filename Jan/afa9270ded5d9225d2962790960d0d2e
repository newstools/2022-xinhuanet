LILONGWE, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera on Monday dissolved his cabinet amid speculations that many of the highest political figures, judiciary and others are involved in a corruption case involving UK-based Malawian businessman, Zuneth Sattar, who is being investigated by both Malawi and UK anti-corruption agencies. This followed a leaked phone conversation between the Malawi Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) chief, Martha Chizuma, and an unidentified caller, in which the ACB chief made some sensitive revelations concerning investigations of the corruption case. The president has since issued a stern warning to Chizuma for her conduct in the leaked phone call, which he described as misconduct.  ■
