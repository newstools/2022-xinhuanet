TRIPOLI, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Ambassador to Libya Giuseppe Buccino on Monday stressed the importance of Libya's stability for the Mediterranean region. "Libya's stability is crucial for the stability of the Mediterranean region," Buccino was quoted as saying by a statement released by Libya's Foreign Ministry. The Italian diplomat made the remarks during a meeting with Libyan Foreign Minister Najla Mangoush here on Monday, according to the statement. The two officials also discussed recent developments in Libya, bilateral collaboration, and a variety of areas of mutual concern, including illegal migration, according to the statement. Buccino pledged that his country would assist Libya's National Unity Government in achieving stability and security. The two officials also discussed an initiative put forward by Mangoush to address illegal migration based on Libyan-international coordination, the statement added. Since the fall of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the North African country has become a point of departure for illegal migrants seeking to cross the Mediterranean Sea to European ports. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 32,000 illegal migrants were rescued and returned to Libya in 2021.  ■
