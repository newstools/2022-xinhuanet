by Marja Vogric LJUBLJANA, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Slovenian politicians on Wednesday criticized Prime Minister Janez Jansa for his remarks on Taiwan, saying Jansa's words are "not in line with (Slovenia's) foreign policy." Referring to Jansa's statements, former Prime Minister Miro Cerar told Xinhua in an earlier interview that "it is disturbing that the government is not seeking a wider political and social consensus on it." He pointed out that Slovenia has not renounced its support to the one-China policy, adding that the parliament should clarify its position on this issue. Nik Prebil, a parliamentary member of the center-left party Lista Marjana Sarca, said in a statement that the party was appalled by the inappropriate statements and actions of Jansa. "These actions are destroying good relations, good diplomatic ties that we have with China," Prebil said, noting that they could bring severe consequences to Slovenia. Matjaz Nemec, vice president of Slovenian political party the Social Democrats and member of the Committee on Foreign Policy of the National Assembly of Slovenia, said the prime minister's conduct "is not in line with (Slovenia's) foreign policy." The party has also demanded a session of the parliamentary committee on the prime minister's statements. Minister of Economic Development and Technology Zdravko Pocivalsek posted on his Facebook that China is one of Slovenia's largest economic partners outside the European Union, with economic cooperation between the two sides deepening.  ■
