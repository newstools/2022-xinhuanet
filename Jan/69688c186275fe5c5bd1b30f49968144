YAOUNDE, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) favorites Nigeria bowed out of the tournament on Sunday night after a 1-0 defeat by Tunisia in the round of 16. Nigeria took control in the opening minutes, cutting through Tunisia's defense and bombarding the goal with shots during the match at Roumde Adjia Stadium. However, it was Tunisia who took the lead moments into the second half, when Youssef Msakni dribbled past a defender and struck a hard shot that beat Nigeria goalkeeper Maduka Okoye. Nigeria continued to attack, but things went from bad to worse for the Super Eagles as substitute Alex Iwobi was shown a straight red card for a foul on Msakni. The Tunisians held on to secure only their second win of the tournament and advance to the quarterfinals, where they will play Burkina Faso, who eliminated Gabon 7-6 on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra-time. Substitute Ismahila Ouedraogo netted the decisive penalty after a tense and energy-packed clash.  ■
