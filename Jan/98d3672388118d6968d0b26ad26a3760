TRIPOLI, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- UN envoy Stephanie Williams on Tuesday stressed the need to respect the timeline of the roadmap set by the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF). Williams, special adviser to the UN secretary-general on Libya, made her remarks here during a meeting with Maltese Ambassador to Libya Charles Saliba. "We discussed the political situation in Libya and agreed on the need for the House of Representatives to put the elections firmly back on track, through an inclusive path and clear timelines," she tweeted. "I noted the need to respect the timeline of the LPDF Roadmap which runs until June of this year and is endorsed by the UN Security Council," Williams said. The roadmap includes holding general elections in the country in December 2021. And yet the elections failed to be held on time and were postponed indefinitely due to technical and legal issues, according to the Libyan High National Elections Commission.  ■
