KABUL, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's caretaker government on Wednesday called on the international community to formally recognize the Taliban administration. "Afghanistan has met all criteria and conditions needed for recognition of a government, therefore I am calling upon the world countries to dare and recognize the legitimate government (of) the Islamic Emirate and extend support to Afghans," Mullah Hassan Akhund, acting prime minister of the caretaker government, said here during an economic conference. This is the first time that Akhund made major public appearance since he assumed the role in September last year. Meanwhile, Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi, acting foreign minister of the caretaker government, said during the conference that the government invites "leading international companies, governments and investors to invest in various sectors of Afghanistan." In 2001, U.S.-led military forces invaded Afghanistan under the pretext of searching for Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Twenty years later, the last batch of U.S. troops left Afghanistan at midnight on Aug. 30, 2021, hastily putting an end to the prolonged invasion war, which has caused more than 40,000 civilian deaths, and turned about 11 million people into refugees. The Taliban took over Kabul in mid-August, and announced in early September the formation of Afghanistan's caretaker government and some important personnel arrangements.  ■
