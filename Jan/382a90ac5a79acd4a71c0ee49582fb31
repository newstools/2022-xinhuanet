ALGIERS, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune on Saturday held phone talks with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron after months of diplomatic tension. According to a statement issued by the Algerian presidency, the two sides "discussed bilateral cooperation and the prospects of convening the higher intergovernmental committee," which had been scheduled last April, but was postponed due to the mounting diplomatic tension between the two sides. According to the statement, the French president renewed the invitation for his Algerian counterpart to attend the sixth European Union - African Union summit, which will be held in Brussels on February 17 and 18. The French-Algerian ties have been characterized by diplomatic riffs in recent months since Algeria recalled its ambassador to France and closed its airspace to French military planes in October, 2021. The move was a response to a Paris' decision in September, 2021 to reduce the number of visas provided to Algerian officials by 50 percent as well Macron's critical remarks on Algeria.  ■
