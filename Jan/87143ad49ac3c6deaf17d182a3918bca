OTTAWA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of trucks and thousands of protesters remained near Parliament Hill on Sunday for a second day to protest the Canadian government's vaccine mandate for essential workers crossing the Canada-U.S. border, despite Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson's call for them to "go back to your home." The "Freedom Convoy 2022" protest began on Saturday as a rally of truckers against the requirement that Canadian truck drivers crossing the border into the United States be fully vaccinated as of mid-January. But one of the organizers of the demonstration said that they are "in this one for the long haul" and plan to remain in the capital until the vaccine mandate is rescinded. Over the weekend, residents of Ottawa's downtown core had to endure all-night honking from vehicles clogging up the streets, public urination and defecation, and the sight of swastikas and upside-down Canadian flags. As of Sunday afternoon, Ottawa police had only made one arrest, but its chief Peter Sloly said that several criminal investigations were underway, including incidents of public mischief, threats and dangerous driving. Canada's House of Commons is to resume sitting on Monday, but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is with his family at an undisclosed location for security reasons, will attend the first question period of 2022 virtually.  ■
