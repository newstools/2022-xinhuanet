JAKARTA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia on Sunday confirmed 12,422 new COVID-19 cases, the highest single-day rise since Aug. 27, 2021, amid the spread of the Omicron variant of the virus in the archipelagic country. The newly recorded infections brought the total tally to 4,343,185, the  Health Ministry said. The death toll from COVID-19 in Indonesia in the past 24 hours rose by 18 to 144,303, while 3,241 more people recovered from the disease, bringing the total number of recoveries to 4,137,164. As the government is accelerating its national vaccination programs to curb the spread of the virus, more than 184.55 million people have received their first dose, while over 128.00 million have taken their second dose in the Southeast Asian country. Indonesia started mass COVID-19 vaccinations in January last year after the authorities approved the emergency use of the Chinese Sinovac vaccine. Aiming to fully vaccinate 208.26 million people in the country, the government has so far administered over 316.76 million doses, including the third booster jabs.  ■
