SOFIA, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Ivan Ivanov, the Bulgarian Minister of Agriculture, said here on Tuesday that he wants to strengthen agricultural cooperation with China. "I personally will be happy if the Chinese side wants to import Bulgarian agricultural products," said Ivanov who took office on Dec. 13, 2021, at a press conference while introducing his team and priorities.
