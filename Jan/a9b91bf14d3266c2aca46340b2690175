"Firefighters of the capital rushed to the scene with great force and put out the fire," the National Directorate General for Disaster Management said in a statement on its website. "They began inspecting and ventilating the hospital. The building will be evacuated," the statement added. The Budapest Police Headquarters confirmed one casualty -- the remains of a woman were found by the firemen as they put out the fire. Two people are being treated for suspected smoke inhalation.
