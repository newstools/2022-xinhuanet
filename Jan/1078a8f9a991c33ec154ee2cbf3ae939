SEOUL, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) fired an unidentified projectile eastward, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said Friday without mentioning further details. It marked the DPRK's third projectile launch this year. The DPRK said earlier this week that it successfully conducted a "hypersonic gliding warhead" test on Tuesday, supervised by top leader Kim Jong Un. The DPRK's Korean Central News Agency said last week that it successfully test-fired a hypersonic missile on Jan. 5.  ■
