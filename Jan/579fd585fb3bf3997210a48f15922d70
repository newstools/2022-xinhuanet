RABAT, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Morocco on Thursday reiterated its support to the stability of Mali, the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. During a telephone conversation with his Malian counterpart Abdoulaye Diop, Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita urged the Malian forces to follow a sustainable path for peace and stability, the statement said. Bourita also expressed Morocco's confidence in the ability of the Malian authorities and forces to take measures to strengthen national cohesion, it said. He also highlighted the importance of Mali's cooperation with the competent international organizations. On Jan. 9, the leadership of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) imposed tough sanctions on Mali, in response to Mali's inability to meet the transition deadline of February 2022 for holding elections. The sanctions include the closure of land and air borders between ECOWAS countries and Mali, the suspension of all financial and economic transactions with Mali, with the exception of essential consumer goods.  ■
