KABUL, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has distributed basic needs to over 1,700 families in Afghanistan's western province of Herat, the UNICEF Afghanistan said on Thursday. "To keep children and women warm and meet their basic needs during this harsh winter @UNICEFafg distributed 5,000 blankets, 1,700 tarpaulin and 1,700 buckets to 1,700 most vulnerable families in Herat Province," the organization wrote on Twitter.
