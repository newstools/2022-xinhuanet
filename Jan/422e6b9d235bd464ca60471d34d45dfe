ABUJA, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday confirmed 19 passengers were killed in a road accident in the country's northwest region on Thursday. In a statement, Buhari described the incident, which occurred on the Kano-Zaria road in the northern region, as an "unfortunate tragedy," expressing sadness over the loss of lives. According to local media reports, 26 passengers were also injured in the accident which occurred when two speeding buses collided and immediately went aflame, causing most of the bus passengers to burn. "I understand that the accident was blamed on over-speeding and this account worries me deeply," the Nigerian leader said, lamenting that the frequency of road accidents is particularly worrisome and called for greater reflection on the importance of safety standards. He advised drivers to take safety regulations seriously, noting they have the responsibility to protect their passengers. "It's unfortunate that ours is a country where, despite regular public enlightenment programs by road safety officials, our recalcitrant drivers treat the issue with indifference," Buhari said. Deadly road accidents are frequently reported in Nigeria, often caused by overloading, bad road conditions, and reckless driving behaviors.  ■
