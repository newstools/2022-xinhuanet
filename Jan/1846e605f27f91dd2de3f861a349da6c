YAOUNDE, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of African Football (CAF) said on Tuesday that an all-female team has been appointed for the first time ever to officiate matches at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Rwandan-born referee Salima Rhadia Mukansanga will make history when she becomes the first woman to referee a match at the AFCON finals. She will take charge when Zimbabwe and Guinea clash in a group stage match on Tuesday at Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Yaounde. The other women to join her in the task are assistant referees Carine Atemzabong of Cameroon and Fatiha Jermoumi from Morocco, as well as VAR Bouchra Karboubi, also from Morocco. "We are super proud of Salima because she has had to work exceptionally hard to be where she is today. We know that for a woman, she has had to overcome serious obstacles to reach this level and she deserves a lot of credit. This moment is not just for Salima but for every young girl in Africa who has passion for football and who sees herself as a referee in the future," said CAF Head of Referees Eddy Maillet, who stressed that the historic moment was as a result of CAF's clear commitment and investment to improve and advance the standard of refereeing in Africa.  ■
