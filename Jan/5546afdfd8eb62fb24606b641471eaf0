LOS ANGELES, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Netflix's "The Power of the Dog" and 20th Century Studios' "West Side Story" took home the top prizes at the 79th Golden Globe Awards on Sunday night, winning best drama and best musical or comedy, respectively. The winners were announced by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) on its official website and social media pages as NBC skipped the controversy-filled event broadcast.
