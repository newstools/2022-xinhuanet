TALLINN, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Estonian Olympic Committee confirmed Friday the lineup of the national team for the Beijing Winter Olympics which will consist of 26 athletes and a 30-member support staff. The size of the Estonian national team is optimal, especially considering the current situation, Estonian Olympic Committee athletic director Martti Raju was quoted as saying by the Estonian Broadcasting Corporation. The athletes will compete in eight disciplines, two more than four years ago in PyeongChang. Five-time X-Games gold medalist Kelly Sildaru, 19, will become the first Estonian to compete in Olympic freestyle skiing in Beijing. Sildaru, also world champion and Youth Winter Olympics gold medalist, missed the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang due to a knee injury. The lineup also include figure skaters Eva-Lotta Kiibus and Aleksandr Selevko, Nordic combined skier Kristjan Ilves and speed skater Marten Liiv among others. Raju added that they are prepared for strict COVID-19 countermeasures, saying that "the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is constantly working with organizers on updating precautions to organize the Games safely." The Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games will take place between Feb. 4 and 20, followed by the Winter Paralympics from March 4 to 13.  ■
