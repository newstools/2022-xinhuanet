ULAN BATOR, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Health Minister Sereejav Enkhbold on Sunday confirmed the country's first five local cases of the COVID-19 Omicron variant. "Today, the first five local COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant were detected in our country," Enkhbold told a press conference. In recent days, more than 1,000 COVID-19 infections have been reported per day in the country due to the New Year celebrations, he said, noting that the number of daily cases is rising. The Asian country on Friday confirmed its first 12 imported cases of the Omicron variant. The detections of the local and imported cases of the Omicron variant have indicated the beginning of a fourth wave of the pandemic in the country, he said, urging the public to remain calm and follow all relevant health guidelines. The fourth wave is expected to peak in late January or early February, according to the minister. The country, home to 3.4 million people, has so far registered more than 395,800 COVID-19 cases, with 1,999 related deaths. So far, 66.5 percent of the total population has received two COVID-19 vaccine doses, while more than 936,000 people aged over 18 have received a third dose. More than 2,000 Mongolians have taken a fourth dose after the country started offering one from Friday on a voluntary basis.  ■
