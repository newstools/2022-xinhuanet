MEXICO CITY, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's annual inflation rate stood at 7.36 percent at the end of 2021, the highest level in more than two decades, figures from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) showed on Friday. In December alone, the National Consumer Price Index rose 0.36 percent over the previous month, due to the increase in prices of some foods and services, INEGI said in its monthly statement. The core inflation, a benchmark for the central bank of Mexico Banxico, was 0.8 percent in December and 5.94 percent in 2021. In a separate report, the Banorte financial group highlighted that both the headline and core inflation reached their highest levels for a full calendar year in 2021 since 2000 in Mexico. Global inflation has accelerated as a result of bottlenecks in production, the reconstitution of merchandise spending, high food and energy prices, and the recovery of some services, while the spread of COVID-19 continues.  ■
