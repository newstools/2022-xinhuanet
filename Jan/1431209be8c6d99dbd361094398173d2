KHARTOUM, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' World Food Program (WFP) on Sunday decided to resume operations in western Sudan's North Darfur State after around two weeks of suspension. WFP Country Director Eddie Rowe announced the resumption of food distribution in different localities of North Darfur, the state-run SUNA news agency reported. Rowe condemned the recent looting and attacks on the agency's warehouses in the state's capital El Fasher, stressing the need to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice. On Dec. 31, 2021, the WFP announced the suspension of its operations in North Darfur, two days after the attacks by unknown armed groups. Over 5,000 metric tons of food were estimated to have been taken away.  ■
