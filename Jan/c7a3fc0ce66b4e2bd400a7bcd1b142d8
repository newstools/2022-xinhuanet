NAIVASHA, Kenya, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) said Friday it will conduct the second and final phase of voter registration from Jan. 17 to Feb. 6, amid intense preparation for Aug. 9 national polls. Wafula Chebukati, the chairman of IEBC, said 4.5 million new voters are targeted in the 20-day exercise, adding that Kenyans in Diaspora will be eligible to obtain a voter's card. "The enhanced continuous voter registration exercise phase 2 offers another opportunity for eligible Kenyans to register as voters, transfer polling stations or change their particulars," Chebukati said at a briefing in the resort town of Naivasha. He clarified that the voter registration exercise for Kenyans living in diaspora will commence on Jan. 21 to Feb. 6 at the country's embassies abroad adding that the agency had put in place solid measures to facilitate a free and fair general election in August. In addition to listing new voters, Chebukati said the electoral agency will later in the year conduct an audit on the voters' register to ensure it was authentic. Kenya's electoral body conducted a voter listing exercise from October to November 2021 as part of preparations for August national polls where citizens will elect a new president, lawmakers and executives at the country's devolved units.  ■
