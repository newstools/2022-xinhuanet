YAOUNDE, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Cameroon's commercial hub of Douala has established fan zones in major parts of the city which will host matches at the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Samuel Dieudonne Ivaha Diboua, governor of the Littoral region of which Douala is the capital, said the fan zones will cater for visitors and locals outside stadiums who cannot afford match tickets. "This is our own way to show that Douala is ready to welcome people. The citizens are proud to welcome people and also to show them the cultural aspects of the city. The zones will be filled with fun during AFCON," Diboua told reporters on Wednesday while inaugurating a 1,500-capacity fan zone constructed on a 400 square meter surface area with shades from trees and a security fence. In addition to live transmission of all AFCON matches, fan zones will offer live concerts by national and international stars, bands, DJs and orchestras, local culinary and industrial exhibition, Diboua said. The 2021 Africa Cup of Nations starts this Sunday and ends on February 6.  Enditem
