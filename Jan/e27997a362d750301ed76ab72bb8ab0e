LJUBLJANA, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- The revenues of Slovenia's state budget in December 2021 totaled a record 1.1 billion euros (1.24 billion U.S. dollars), according to the Finance Ministry's preliminary estimates published here on Monday. According to analysts, the figure reflects a robust economic recovery last year after the COVID-19 pandemic dealt a heavy blow to the country in 2020. Slovenia's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 4.2 percent in 2020 but as shown by the government's September forecast it expanded by about 6.1 percent in 2021, pushed mostly by investments, household spending and exports. According to the ministry, the state budget's revenues, which come largely from taxes, were 51.1 percent higher in December 2021 than in the same month of 2020 and 14.7 percent higher than in December 2019. Expenditure, meanwhile, was also record high at 1.67 billion euros, of which investments totaled 354.8 million euros. In the whole of 2021, investment expenditure increased by 36 percent year-on-year. The ministry expects the country to post a budget deficit for the fiscal year 2021 of 3.1 billion euros, corresponding to 6.14 percent of GDP. In fiscal 2020, the budget deficit was 3.5 billion euros. Slovenia's public debt was estimated at 77.5 percent of GDP at the end of 2021 versus 79.8 percent a year before, the ministry said.
