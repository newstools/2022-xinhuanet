DAKAR, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Municipal and departmental elections in Senegal ended on Sunday as Senegalese President Macky Sall and the country's political leaders called for serenity and calm after casting their votes. Sall, who voted in Fatick, his hometown in central Senegal, praised the vitality of the country's democratic system and the maturity of the people. "I hope the vote can take place everywhere in calm and serenity. Everything must be done in calm and serenity and that the best wins," he said. In the south of the country, Ousmane Sonko, in the opposition, called for respect for the choice of citizens after voting in Ziguinchor. Sonko was the unsuccessful candidate for the last presidential election in 2019. At a polling station in Dakar, the capital of Senegal, reporters saw voters queuing up to vote in a calm and orderly manner. Some polling stations extended their polling hours as voters in some areas were unable to complete their polls by the schedule time, 6 p.m. local time. In total, 6,613,962 Senegalese are expected at the polls to decide 3,149 lists in 557 communes and 43 departments. The vote takes place in 15,066 polling stations across the country. For these elections, there were 250,000 first-time voters after the exceptional revision of the electoral lists. The National Autonomous Electoral Commission (CENA) of Senegal has mobilized 22,000 supervisors and monitors to ensure the proper conduct of the election.  ■
