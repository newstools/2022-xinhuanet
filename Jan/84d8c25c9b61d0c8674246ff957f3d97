NEW DELHI, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- India's Delhi government decided on Thursday to end the weekend curfew and odd-even curbs for markets in the national capital region, local media reported. The authorities have also decided to open restaurants, bars and cinema halls with 50 percent capacity. The night curfew, however, will remain in force. The decision was made during a meeting between the Delhi government and Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal. "The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) also decided to cap the number of people who can attend wedding festivals in the national capital to 200," the report said. The decision has been taken in view of the decline in COVID-19 cases in the capital. Schools will, however, remain shut for now, the report said. The federal health ministry said on Thursday morning that Delhi had recorded 7,498 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the COVID-19 situation in Delhi is under control and the city is expected to report less than 5,000 cases in the next 24 hours.  ■
