BERLIN, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- BMW Group sales, including the brands Rolls Royce and MINI, increased by 8.4 percent to more than 2.52 million units in 2021, with the BMW brand setting a new sales record of 2.21 million units, the German carmaker said on Wednesday. "Despite supply bottlenecks and the continuing coronavirus pandemic, we achieved a strong sales performance in 2021, thanks to a powerful operational performance and stellar product line-up," said board member Pieter Nota. BMW Group sales in China increased by 8.9 percent year-on-year in 2021, with 846,237 BMW and MINI vehicles delivered, as the company posted a new sales record and continued to "lead the premium segment." Already in 2020, the German carmaker achieved record sales in China. In Europe, sales of BMW and MINI brands increased by 3.9 percent to 948,087 units last year, while deliveries in the Americas region recovered from the previous year's COVID-19 losses and were up 18.9 percent at 450.062 units sold. Worldwide sales of fully-electric vehicles by BMW more than doubled in 2021. Sales in China "continued to gain momentum" with a growth of 69.6 percent and more than 21,000 units of the BMW iX3. "With more than 100,000 fully-electric vehicles sold last year, ramping up electromobility was our clear focus," Nota added. By 2023, the German premium carmaker wants to offer at least one fully electric model for around 90 percent of its current market segments. BMW aims to sell around ten million fully-electric vehicles over the next ten years.  ■
