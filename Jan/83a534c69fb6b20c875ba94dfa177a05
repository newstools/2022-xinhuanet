ISLAMABAD, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Ten soldiers were killed when terrorists attacked a security check post in Kech district of Pakistan's southwest Balochistan province, an army statement said. The incident happened "on night of Jan. 25/26. During intense exchange of fire, a terrorist was killed and several injured," the military's media wing Inter-Services Public Relations said in the statement on Thursday. Casualties on the security forces side happened while repulsing the terrorists' raid, the statement said, adding that three terrorists were apprehended in a follow-up clearance operation. A search operation is still underway in the area to hunt down perpetrators of the attack, said the statement. Though the statement did not reveal the identities of the attackers or the arrested terrorists, Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned organization, claimed the attack on social media earlier on Wednesday.  ■
