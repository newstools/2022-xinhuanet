TRIPOLI, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- Libya's Interior Ministry announced on Thursday three security officers were killed by Islamic State (IS) terrorists in southwestern part of the country. "An IS terrorist group attacked a security patrol 80 km west of Qatroun town on Wednesday, killing three security officers," said the ministry in a statement. The security patrol killed four terrorists and destroyed their vehicles in the area, while other terrorists were still being pursued, it added. Since the fall of late leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been plagued by insecurity and disorder, with IS terrorists staging occasional attacks in various parts of the country, particularly in southern Libya.  ■
