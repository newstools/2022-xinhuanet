DHAKA, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in parts of Dhaka on Wednesday urged people through megaphones to wear a face mask outdoors amid rocketing Omicron cases in the capital Dhaka and elsewhere in the country. Bangladesh's new COVID-19 cases soared by 9,500 in the past 24 hours by 8:00 a.m. local time Wednesday, taking the total caseload to 1,642,294, according to the latest government data. It is the highest number in a day since Aug. 12 last year and an over 25 percent jump from the previous day. The current positivity rate reached 25.11 percent Wednesday, from 23.98 percent Tuesday. The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) reported 12 new deaths on Wednesday, taking the death toll to 28,176. Health officials in Dhaka said the gradual surge in the infection indicates that the country's COVID-19 situation is worsening again. The official data showed that 37,830 samples were tested in the last 24 hours of Wednesday. The total number of recovered patients in the country stood at 1,554,268, including 473 new recoveries, said the DGHS. According to the official data, the COVID-19 fatality rate in Bangladesh is 1.72 percent and the current recovery rate is 94.64 percent. To combat the fresh COVID-19 outbreak, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has recently urged unvaccinated people to get inoculated soon in order to protect themselves from the ongoing COVID-19 resurgence triggered by the Omicron variant. Hasina said the Omicron variant is spreading fast and families are getting infected, calling on all people in the country to follow the health protocols properly and abide by the latest directives issued by the authorities. Bangladeshi authorities have already launched booster shots and started imposing stringent rules to combat the fresh spike in COVID-19 infections, specially the Omicron variant. Bangladesh on Dec. 11 last year reported its first cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.  ■
