MOSCOW, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the U.S. State of Texas Greg Abbott has criticized the White House for causing illegal crossings on the border with Mexico, Russian broadcaster RT reported on Friday. The current administration has endangered the lives and property of Texans by failing to do its job of securing the border, the governor said. According to the report, Texas state troopers have arrested thousands of migrants under Operation Lone Star, which was launched by Abbott last March, in an attempt to combat the smuggling of illegal aliens and drugs. Illegal border crossings into the United States skyrocketed to a 61-year high in 2021, it added.  ■
