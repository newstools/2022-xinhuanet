SYDNEY, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Solomon Islands has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases for the first time, with leaders warning of a worse situation. The country has reported no COVID-19 fatalities throughout the pandemic. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said 48 locally transmitted cases were reported on Thursday, bringing the tally to 81. The fast-evolving crisis is already crippling the nation's resources, said the Ministry of Health and Medical Services on Friday. Sogavare, speaking at a press conference on Thursday, said the nation's largest hospital in the capital of Honiara had 56 beds, 50 of which were already occupied. "I have been told the numbers of positive cases could be even higher tomorrow," he said. "If that is right, we will not have rooms to put the positive cases into." The outbreak has led the government to impose a snap lockdown on Honiara on Wednesday, which is due to continue until 6:00 a.m. on Saturday. "It is a lockdown and police will arrest and charge those who breach it," said Juanita Matanga, deputy commissioner of operations of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. "I call on all communities in Honiara to adhere to health protocols and cooperate with each other to protect our family, community and the country as we try to manage the transmission of COVID-19."  ■
