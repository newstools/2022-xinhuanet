LIBREVILLE, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- The National Olympic Committee of Gabon (CNOG) wished the upcoming Beijing Olympic Winter Games great success in a statement released here on Friday. "The CNOG wishes that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics will be a great success like the Summer Olympics in 2008," said CNOG President Leon Folquet, highlighting China's "greatness in organizing major sporting events."

Folquet also noted that the two friendly countries have maintained time-honored cooperation in sports, hailing the construction by Chinese companies of various sports stadiums, which has allowed Gabon to host the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) twice.
