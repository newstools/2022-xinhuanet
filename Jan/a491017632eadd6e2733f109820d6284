PHNOM PENH, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's anti-drug police have arrested a Vietnamese man for allegedly trafficking, storing and processing over 181 kg of illicit drugs, a Phnom Penh Municipal police spokesman said on Tuesday. Luu Tung Huy, 25, was caught on Dec. 30 at night during a raid at the suspect's three locations in capital Phnom Penh's Boeung Keng Kang and Meanchey districts, said Phnom Penh Municipal police spokesman San Sok Seiha. The southeast Asian nation has no death sentence for drug traffickers. Under its law, someone found guilty of trafficking more than 80 grams of illicit drugs could be imprisoned for life. According to the Anti-Drug Department, in 2021, the authorities had detained 13,765 drug suspects in 6,242 cases across the country, confiscating some 4.43 tons of illicit drugs. The seized drugs last year included heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, methamphetamine pills, cathinone and ketamine, among others.  Enditem
