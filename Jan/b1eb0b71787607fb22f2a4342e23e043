DAR ES SALAAM, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Five people, including four children, have been killed by lightning strike in Tanzania's western district of Kibondo in Kigoma region, police said on Wednesday. James Manyama, the Kigoma regional police commander, said the four children were hit by lightning on Tuesday at 6 p.m. local time in Kibuye village. "All the four children who were playing under a mango tree were from different families," Manyama told a press conference, adding that the fifth victim, a woman, was hit by the lightning when she was farming on Tuesday evening. The police official urged parents and guardians not to allow their children to play under trees during the ongoing rains to avoid being hit by lightning.  Enditem
