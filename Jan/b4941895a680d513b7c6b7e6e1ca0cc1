CAIRO, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Youth Forum (WYF) held in Egypt offered a real opportunity for exchanging views through constructive dialogues, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said on Thursday. Sisi made the remarks at the closing session of the 4th WYF held in Egypt's Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, with the participation of Egyptian and international organizations, civil society institutions, and young people from across the world. The Egyptian president said the WYF 2022 created "a state of serious and constructive dialogue for the sake of establishing peace and achieving sustainable development through ideas and creativity of the world's youth." He declared the year 2022 as "a Year of Civil Society," during which the forum and the relevant bodies in Egypt will establish a platform for dialogue between the state and the youth, as well as local and international civil society institutions. Among other proposals that Sisi made included assigning the forum to establish youth groups comprising local and foreign members to let them take part in the preparations for the 27th UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) scheduled for later this year in Sharm El-Sheikh. The forum was also asked to activate a permanent platform for interactive dialogue between the youth from Egypt and the world to share visions and ideas. "Its outcomes shall be presented periodically to the various state institutions, providing the state with a forward-looking vision on all issues and dossiers of interest," said Sisi. The 4th WYF was held on Jan. 10-13 with the participation of leaders, officials and youth delegations from about 196 countries, whether in person or via video conference.  ■
