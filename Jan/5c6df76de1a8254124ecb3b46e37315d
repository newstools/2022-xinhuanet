LONDON, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- All testing measures for eligible fully vaccinated travellers arriving in Britain will be scrapped from next month, as the government goes one step further to reopen the travel sector. From 4 am (0400 GMT) on Feb. 11, all testing requirements will be removed for eligible fully vaccinated arrivals, with only a Passenger Locator Form now required, according to a statement released Monday by the British government. Arrivals not recognized as fully vaccinated will need to take a pre-departure test and a PCR test on or before day 2 after they arrive in the country. "This final step in our stable and safe full return to international travel is a major boost for UK tourism, setting Britain free ahead of the crucial half term and spring holiday season," British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in the statement. The country is also set to recognize vaccine certificates from 16 more countries, including China and Mexico, bringing the recognition total to more than 180 countries and territories worldwide, according to the statement. Official figures on Monday showed Britain added 88,447 COVID-19 cases in the latest 24 hours, bringing the total caseload to 15,953,685, and a further 56 deaths, taking the national death toll to 153,916. More than 90 percent of people aged 12 and above in Britain have had their first dose of vaccine, more than 83 percent have received both shots, and more than 64 percent have received booster jabs.  ■
