YAOUNDE, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- At least six people died following a stampede at a stadium hosting ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon on Monday night, said Naseri Paul Bea, governor of the Centre Region. The tragedy occurred as football fans tried to make their way into the stadium where a crucial knockout game between Cameroon and Comoros was being played. Bea said "several" other people were injured and rushed to a hospital in the capital Yaounde where the sporting infrastructure is located. Authorities fear the death toll could increase. Emmanuel Njomo who witnessed the incident told Xinhua that over 1,000 people tried to push their way through the stadium entrance at the same. "Everyone was impatient and wanted to get into the stadium to watch the match which had already started. They pushed the security barriers and that's where troubled started," Njomo said, adding that some children and women either died or were injured during the stampede. The stadium has 60,000 seats but could only operate at 80 percent of capacity due to COVID-19 restrictions.  ■
