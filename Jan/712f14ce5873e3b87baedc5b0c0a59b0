MUMBAI, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- India's instant payment system, Unified Payment Interface (UPI), was restored after hours of technical glitch on Sunday evening. Terming it as an "intermittent technical glitch," National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) that has developed UPI said, "UPI is operational now, and we are monitoring system closely." Several users had taken to social media to air their grievance about their inability to complete their transactions using their digital wallets and on online payment platforms like Google Pay and Paytm. Responding to a user's grievance, India's private sector lender, HDFC Bank, said on micro-blogging site, "All UPI payments are down. Once the problem at NPCI end is sorted, we will be able to re-start UPI payment services again. We sincerely regret the inconvenience." "After approximately 3 hours down time, the UPI servers started working," said Mahesh Sai, a user on micro-blogging site. UPI is largely used for small ticket payments with 140 million transactions per day and an average transaction size of 24.7 U.S. dollars and 50 percent volume below three dollars, according to a recent report.  ■
