TRIPOLI, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Prime Minister Abdul-Hamid Dbeibah on Saturday stressed the importance of the contribution of young physicians to improving the healthcare in Libya. "We are confident of the ability of our young physicians to improve the healthcare in our country, when needs are provided. This serves our quest to provide proper healthcare in all parts of the country," Dbeibah said during a speech at the second training forum of medical students and young physicians, held in the capital Tripoli. The forum, which brings together a large number of young physicians and medical students across the country, seeks to come up with scientific recommendations and launch training programs to improve the capabilities of young physicians in Libya. Due to years of armed conflict and instability, Libyan authorities have been struggling to provide proper basic services, mainly in areas of healthcare and education, for its people.  ■
