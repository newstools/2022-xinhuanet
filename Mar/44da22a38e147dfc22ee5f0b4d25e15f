DHAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Monday slammed the U.S. sanctions on officials of Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) over alleged rights abuse, saying the move was "very condemnable act". She said the elite force has immensely contributed to the country's efforts in containing militancy and terrorism. Hasina said Bangladesh takes legal action against any law enforcement agency members including those from RAB if they are found involved in any criminal act. Bangladeshi Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said earlier that the allegations of gross rights violations by the anti-crime elite police unit were not "based on facts" and RAB was a disciplined institution that instead "has been securing human rights for the people of Bangladesh." In December last year, the U.S. Departments of Treasury and the Department of State imposed human rights-related sanctions on RAB and seven incumbent and former top officials of the elite force.  ■
