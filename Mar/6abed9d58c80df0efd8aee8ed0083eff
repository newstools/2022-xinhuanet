TEGUCIGALPA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Honduras extradited Oscar Fernando Santos Tobar (alias "El Teto") to the United States, where he is wanted on drug trafficking charges, the Public Prosecutor's Office announced on Tuesday. Santos Tobar was arrested last August in the municipality of El Paraiso in the department of Copan, after posting videos on social media showing his luxurious lifestyle. In October 2021, a judge granted his extradition following a request from a court in the U.S. state of Texas on drug trafficking charges. He is said to be linked to the cartel led by the Valle brothers (Miguel Arnulfo and Luis Alonso), both imprisoned in the United States, as well as to another criminal group led by Alexander Ardon, also incarcerated in the United States. The alleged drug trafficker was the first person to be extradited to the United States this year and was met by U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents when he landed.  ■
