CAIRO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt signed a total of 10 billion U.S. dollars of development finance agreements with its development partners in 2021, said Minister of International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat on Wednesday. "Nearly three billion dollars out of the ten-billion-U.S. dollar deals were allocated to human capital investment, especially in sectors of education, health, small and medium projects, food security and women empowerment," Al-Mashat said during the Arab Parliamentarian Forum for Population and Development in Egypt. Al-Mashat said that the population issue has gained exceptional importance over the past seven years in Egypt amid developmental vision of the government for improving the living conditions and investing in vital sectors like education, health and social protection. Egypt secured 10 billion U.S. dollars in loans in 2021, and 9.8 billion dollars in 2020, according to the minister.  ■
