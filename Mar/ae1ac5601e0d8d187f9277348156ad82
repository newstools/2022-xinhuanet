NEW DELHI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- India's Ujjain city in the central state of Madhya Pradesh has set a world record by lighting over 1.1 million earthen oil lamps during a Hindu festival, officials said Wednesday. The festival was celebrated Tuesday evening across India, and Ujjain set a new Guinness World Record by lighting a record number of lamps. "The people of Ujjain have set a new record by lighting 1,171,078 earthen oil lamps together at Ramghat, Datta Akhara, Narsingh Ghat, Guru Nanak Ghat and Sunhari Ghat," said a public relations official with the Ujjain administration. "With this achievement, the previous record of lighting 941,000 lamps made in Ayodhya last November has been broken," the official added. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan started the program by lighting 15 lamps. Reports said the Guinness World Records had sent a five-member team to Ujjain to judge the bid for the record of the largest display of oil lamps. ■
