JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Egypt agreed to expand direct flights between the two countries, launching a new direct route between Tel Aviv and Sharm El-Sheikh, Israel said on Wednesday. The new flights between Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv and the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheik in the Sinai Peninsula will be inaugurated in April, according to a statement issued by the Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office. Bennett welcomed the new deal, saying "this agreement will further warm the relations between Israel and Egypt." He added that the cooperation between Israel and Egypt is "expanding in many fields," and this is contributing to both peoples and to regional stability. The new route was discussed at a meeting between Bennett and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Sharm El-Sheikh last September, and one month later, Egypt's flag carrier EgyptAir opened a flight route from Cairo to Tel Aviv.  ■
