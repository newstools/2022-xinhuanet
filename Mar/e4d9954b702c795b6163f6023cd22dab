JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States has a lot to account for human rights violations at home and abroad, but the country just took advantage of its discourse power to hide its poor records on human rights, a South African youth leader has written. "The general global discourse power is skewed towards the West and is overwhelmingly aligned with the U.S.," wrote Buyile Matiwane, deputy-president of the South African Students Congress, in an opinion piece published on South Africa's Independent Online news website on Thursday. The current general discourse on human rights is based on the West's bias and confusion, making it impossible to accurately and objectively assess other countries' commitment to human rights and civil liberties, Matiwane said, noting that the one-sided and limited coverage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is one of the latest blatant examples. The international community must first examine the U.S. human rights records to determine whether the country should have "so much power and authority on issues relating to human rights," Matiwane wrote. While facing deep-rooted problems at home such as gun violence, racial inequality, and immigration crisis, which were even worsened after the outbreak of COVID-19, the United States has also created human rights crises in other countries, he wrote. "Americans must first fix what has gone wrong at home and rethink how they deal with the rest of the world," the author quoted Stephen Walt, an international relations professor at Harvard University, as saying.  ■
