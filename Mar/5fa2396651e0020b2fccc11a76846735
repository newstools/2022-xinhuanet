PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- As the COVID-19 pandemic is making its latest comeback in parts of the northeastern United States, officials fear that further congressional inaction would hinder America's preparation for the upcoming wave of pandemic, France 24 has reported. Amid the rebound of the pandemic, the U.S. Congress declined to add 22.5 billion U.S. dollars in COVID-19 funding to a spending bill passed last week, and officials are urging Congress to pass new funding or risk the supply of future treatments and vaccines, reported the state-owned international news network, citing an AFP report on Wednesday. "If the science shows that fourth doses are needed for the general population later this year, we will not have the supply necessary to ensure shots are available, free and easy to access for all Americans," White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients was quoted as saying. "Further congressional inaction will set us back, leave us less prepared, and cost more lives," Zients said.  ■
