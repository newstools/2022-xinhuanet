BERLIN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany's nationwide seven-day incidence of COVID-19 infections hit a new record, rising to 1,543 per 100,000 inhabitants, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases said on Monday. As the country is hit by the Omicron wave, COVID-19 cases have started rising again. The RKI on Monday registered 92,378 new COVID-19 infections within 24 hours, around 14,000 more than last week. "Germany now has the highest COVID-19 incidence in Europe," said Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach on Twitter on Sunday. In view of the upward trend, he stressed that "unvaccinated should urgently get vaccinated." With only 605,000 vaccinations administered last week, Germany's vaccination campaign continues to slow down. According to official figures, at least 48.1 million people have received a booster dose, while 19.6 million people are still not vaccinated. Due to less severe cases associated with the Omicron variant, the federal and state governments have agreed to gradually relax most COVID-19 measures by March 20. However, basic protective measures such as wearing a mask in certain areas will remain in place.  ■
