TUNIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tunisian maritime guard on Friday found 12 bodies of illegal immigrants of African and Syrian nationalities off the Nabeul coast in northeastern Tunisia. These illegal immigrants might have lost their lives when their boat sank during the trip toward the European coasts, the private radio station Mosaique FM reported. Since the beginning of 2022, some 870 illegal immigrants have managed to reach the Italian coasts, the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights (FTDES) revealed on Wednesday. Thousands of illegal immigrants attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea every year, and Tunisia is one of the main points of access to Europe through irregular channels.  ■
