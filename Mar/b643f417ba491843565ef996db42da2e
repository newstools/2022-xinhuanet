VIENTIANE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The year-on-year inflation rate in Laos jumped to 7.3 percent in February 2022, the highest figure recorded in the country since January 2016. The surge in consumer prices has been driven by the spiraling cost of fuel and other imported products due to the continuing depreciation of the Lao kip, according to the latest report from the Lao Statistics Bureau. The demand for foreign currencies, notably U.S. dollars and Thai baht, remains high as Lao businesses must use these currencies to import goods, local daily Vientiane Times reported on Friday. Consumer prices surged more than expected over the past seven months, driven by both internal and external factors. According to the Lao Statistics Bureau, the external factors impacting the costs of goods and services are mostly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine crisis, resulting in a volatile global fuel market. The price of fuel in Laos has increased six times so far in 2022, which has had a huge impact on the inflation rate. According to the Lao Statistics Bureau, the cost of meat and fish lifted by 5.3 percent year-on-year, while the price of fruit and vegetables rose by 6.8 percent year-on-year. The price of medical care and medicines rose by 0.38 percent month-on-month and 9.39 percent year-on-year. Prices in the restaurant and hotel category gained by 0.11 percent month-on-month and 8.65 percent year-on-year. The cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages in February increased by 0.45 percent month-on-month and 5.47 percent year-on-year. The Lao government is taking steps to boost production in order to reduce imports, and to control the rising price of fuel to ease the impact on the economy and the general public. The government has decided to cut Value Added Tax from 10 to 7 percent this year and cut all fuel reserves, according to the report.  ■
