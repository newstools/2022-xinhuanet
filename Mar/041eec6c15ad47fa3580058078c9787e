ANKARA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish prosecutors on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for 147 suspects over their alleged links to a network accused of orchestrating a coup attempt in 2016. The chief prosecutor of the capital Ankara issued a warrant for 132 suspects who were allegedly linked to the Gulen Movement "structure" in the Gendarmerie General Command, the semi-official Anadolu Agency reported. The suspects included two active-duty and 74 dismissed officials, along with 56 private-sector employees. The police have been conducting raids across 50 provinces. Meanwhile, the Ankara chief prosecutor issued a warrant for 15 other suspects as part of an investigation into the group members in the health sector. Four of them were on active duty, and the rest of the suspects were previously dismissed, the agency reported. The Turkish government accuses Gulen Movement of infiltrating into the state bureaucracy and then attempting a coup on July 15, 2016. The movement, which mainly runs schools around the world, is a community of people named after Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen, who is regarded by followers as a spiritual leader. Ankara accuses U.S.-based Fethullah Gulen of masterminding the attempted coup, in which at least 250 people were killed. Ankara requests the extradition of Gulen, but Washington is reluctant to extradite the self-exiled Islamic cleric, saying that Turkey has not presented sufficient evidence against him. The Turkish government has launched a massive crackdown on suspects with links to the network in the aftermath of the coup attempt.  ■
