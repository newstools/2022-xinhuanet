TRIPOLI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) announced on Tuesday that it resumed production at the country's two major oil fields after days of hiatus. The NOC announced it stopped production at the two fields on Sunday after an armed group closed the pumping valves in the oil fields, and declared force majeure, a legal maneuver that lets a company get out of its contracts because of extraordinary circumstances. The NOC said it has revoked the force majeure and will continue to produce oil there. "The National Oil Corporation confirms that production continues gradually, with the aim to return to production rates prior to the closure," the NOC said in a statement. The NOC added the current daily oil production in the North African country exceeds 1.1 million barrels. Oil and gas represent a major source of Libya's revenue. However, the sector has suffered over the past years from armed conflict and closures of oil fields and ports.  ■
