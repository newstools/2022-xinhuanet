LUSAKA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's economy grew by 3.6 percent in 2021 from a 3.1 percent contraction in 2020, according to figures released by the Zambia Statistics Agency on Thursday. In a release, the agency attributed the growth to positive performance of the information and communication industry which accounted for the highest contribution at 1.2 followed by the construction industry at 1.1 percent. However, mining and quarrying, education as well as public administration contributed negatively to the growth at 0.7 percent, 0.04 percent and 0.03 percent respectively. Last year, the economy of Africa's second-largest copper producer contracted for the first time since 1999 mainly on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the country's annual inflation rate for March decreased to 13.1 percent from 14.2 percent in February. ■
