ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police on Tuesday detained at least 105 suspects over their alleged links to a network accused of orchestrating a coup attempt in 2016, semi-official Anadolu Agency reported. Izmir's prosecutor issued a warrant for the arrest of 101 suspects who were allegedly linked to the Gulen movement "structure" in the Turkish Armed Forces, including 28 soldiers and 73 cadets that were dismissed after the coup attempt, according to the report. The security forces detained 87 of the suspects in simultaneous operations across 38 cities of Turkey. In a separate operation based in capital Ankara, the police detained at least 18 suspects for being affiliated to the group's "structure" in the Land Forces Command. The Turkish government accuses Gulen movement, a community of people named after Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen, of infiltrating into the state bureaucracy and then attempting a coup on July 15, 2016. Ankara accuses U.S.-based Fethullah Gulen of masterminding the attempted coup, in which at least 250 people were killed. The Turkish government has launched a massive crackdown on suspects with links to the network in the aftermath of the coup attempt.  ■
