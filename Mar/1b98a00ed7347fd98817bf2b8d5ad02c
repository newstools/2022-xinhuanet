LISBON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese government's Council of Ministers approved on Friday a resolution to subsidize the fuel consumed by freight transporters, intending to mitigate the sharp rise in prices seen in recent days. The decision authorizes a benefit of 30 eurocents (33 U.S. dollar cents) per liter of fuel for transporters of vehicles up to 35 tons, in addition to 20 eurocents for heavy vehicles from 35 tons. "The pollutant emission control liquid," which works in the exhaust system of diesel vehicles will also be subsidized "regardless of the vehicle's weight," said a statement from the Council of Ministers. According to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Housing, the support will be paid in a single monthly installment, calculated according to fuel consumption according to the tonnage of the vehicles. The measure aims to reinforce support for companies affected by fuel price inflation, which has risen by an average of 10 percent in the last two weeks. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa had already announced a package benefiting individual consumers in general, the main measure being the return of amounts charged as Tax on Petroleum Products.
