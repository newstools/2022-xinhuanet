DHAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- As part of its continued efforts to revive the golden era of jute, the Bangladeshi government on Sunday observed the National Jute Day in the country like previous years. This year the slogan of the day is "Golden country of olden fibre -- Environment friendly Bangladesh". On the eve of the day, Bangladeshi President Abdul Hamid and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued separate messages greeting the people involved with the jute sector. The day was inaugurated with a colorful rally in capital Dhaka, in which Bangladeshi Minister for Textiles and Jute Golam Dastagir Gazi attended. A three-day fair of jute goods also kicked off in the capital on March 6-8. Addressing the inaugural function of the fair, the minister said jute fairs will help increase the demand for jute products in the country as well as the sales by entrepreneurs. "This will encourage entrepreneurs to export more jute products outside the country," said the minister, adding that jute products are gaining acceptance day by day.  ■
