OTTAWA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Over half of Canadians (54 percent) said they had a close friend or family member who was infected with COVID-19 during the past two years and more than one in three (36 percent) had an infection in their household, a new survey revealed on Thursday. The online survey, carried out by the Angus Reid Institute and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, polled a representative randomized sample of 2,550 Canadians aged 18 and over between March 1 to 4 of this year on the occasion of the two-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring the COVID-19 outbreaks worldwide a pandemic. "The findings are stark," the Angus Reid Institute said. An overwhelming majority (82 percent) said they believed the pandemic had pulled people apart as opposed to bringing them together (18 percent). About the same number (79 percent) said this period had brought out the worst, not the best (21 percent) in people. Nearly two-thirds (61 percent) said Canadians' level of compassion for one another had weakened. Despite the developments and lessons in the last 24 months, Canadians were jaded about how well this country was equipped to handle a future pandemic. Most (70 percent) believed Canada would "struggle just as much" in the next pandemic - while fewer than half that number (30 percent) said the nation was in "good shape" to handle something similar happening again. Seven-in-ten Canadians (72 percent) postponed travel at some point during the past two years. Half (48 percent) delayed medical appointments, while one-quarter (26 percent) delayed a more serious medical procedure or surgery, according to the key findings of the survey. CTV updated Thursday that Canada, with a population of 37 million, recorded its national COVID-19 caseload of 3,349,193 with 37,222 related deaths.  ■
