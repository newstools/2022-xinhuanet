CAIRO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian-Austrian archaeological mission working in the Temple of Kom Ombo in Egypt's southern province of Aswan unearthed an administrative facility that dates back to the First Intermediate Period spanning from 2181 BC to 2050 BC. More than 20 conical silos were discovered in the large administrative facility probably used for piling and distributing grain, said Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, in a statement. The architectural elements of the two-meter-deep silos, domes, ladders and storage rooms are in good condition, according to the statement. Describing the discovery as "unique," Waziri said it reflects the importance of Kom Ombo city during the First Intermediate Period as an agricultural and commercial center and that the city was inhabited by a large number of people.  ■
