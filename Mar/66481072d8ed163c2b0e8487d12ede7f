PRETORIA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is a water-scarce country with its quality under threat, said Minister of Water and Sanitation Senzo Mchunu on Tuesday, World Water Day. He said South Africa is ranked the 30th driest country in the world, receiving summer rainfall from November to March. "Since the surface water resources are fully allocated, our water supply needs are supplemented by international transfers from the Lesotho Highland Water Transfer Scheme. In order to meet the increase in water demand, we have gradually increased groundwater use through the groundwater development scheme," said Mchunu. He stated that studies have shown that Southern Africa will experience water scarcity to meet human and ecosystem needs as a result of climate change. "We have acknowledged that our country's water resources are on the decline in both quality and quantity. We are not the only country facing water quality challenges. The World Economic Forum Global Risks Report of 2019 reports that water and environmental concerns are more prevalent than ever," he added. Mchunu said the Water Research Commission (WRC) have researched on water shortages and qualities and made recommendations which have informed policy. He said there has been slow translation of science into policy.  ■
