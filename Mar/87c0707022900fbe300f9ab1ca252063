KHARTOUM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Chairman of Sudan's Transitional Sovereign Council Mohamed Hamdan Daqlu stressed that dialogue is the only solution to the current political crisis in the country. Daqlu made the remarks during a press conference at Khartoum airport upon his return on Wednesday from a visit to Russia. He urged all the Sudanese political components to show wisdom, saying "the one who protests against us is the one who rejects dialogue, and we extend our hands for dialogue." "We want consensus, and we hope to return to dialogue, because eventually we will reach dialogue, and therefore it is better to start now," Daqalu said. Daqalu noted the country has landed in a political impasse, "with no consensus reached or a government formed, no prime minister and no one wants elections," urging political factions to achieve reconciliation so the country can start an election. Daqalu started an official visit to Russia on Feb. 23 in response to an invitation from Russian government. He stressed that "the Russian-Sudanese ties are historic, deeply-rooted and based on cooperation and mutual respect." Sudan has been suffering a political crisis after the General Commander of the Sudanese Army Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan declared a state of emergency on Oct. 25, 2021, and dissolved the Sovereign Council and the government. Since then, opposition groups have been staging regular mass protests in the Sudanese capital Khartoum and other cities to demand civilian rule.  ■
