NEW YORK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- New York City on Thursday provided exemptions of COVID-19 vaccine mandate to professional athletes, performing artists and their accompanying individuals while the decision drew criticism from various groups. New York City Mayor Eric Adams excluded professional athletes, performing artists and their accompanying individuals from covered workers, who are still subject to the Key to NYC program. Adams amended an emergency executive order in this regard which took effect immediately. "Being healthy is not just about being physically healthy, but being economically healthy," said Adams. It's reported that professional athletes like Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving can't play in home games due to the vaccine mandate. A provision in the city's private-sector mandate that exempts out-of-town athletes and performers is unfair to New York City and its sports teams while the city heavily relies on tourism, according to Adams. However, the decision to loosen vaccine mandate for selected groups was accused of playing double standards with criticism from groups of sanitation workers, policemen and teachers. "There can't be one system for the elite and another for the essential workers of our city," Harry Nespoli, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association and chairman of the Municipal Labor Committee, said in a statement. "If the mandate isn't necessary for famous people, then it's not necessary for the cops who are protecting our city in the middle of a crime crisis," said Patrick Lynch, president of Police Benevolent Association of New York City. More than 1,400 municipal workers, mostly teachers, had been fired in New York City for failing to get vaccinated, according to earlier reports.  ■
