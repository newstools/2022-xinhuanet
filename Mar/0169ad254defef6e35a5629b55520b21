COLOMBO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Litro Gas company on Thursday began distributing 1 million gas cylinders in different areas of the South Asian country as a gas shortage has led to lengthy queues at gas stations recently. Chairman of Litro Gas Lanka, Theshara Jayasinghe told journalists in Colombo that 1 million cylinders of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) would be distributed in the country in the next 10 days. Earlier this month, Litro Gas along with another gas company Laugfs Gas said they would not be able to import any more liquefied petroleum gas as banks were not letting them open letters of credit in U.S. dollars. That was due to Sri Lanka presently facing a foreign exchange shortage. Retailers had voiced concerns over a gas shortage in the market, leading to lengthy queues at gas stations. The Sri Lankan government last week said the necessary payment for the gas shipments were made and gas cylinders would be distributed in the market soon.  ■
