HARARE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government said Tuesday that all visitors and returning residents are no longer required to provide a negative PCR certificate as long as they are fully vaccinated. Addressing a media briefing after a cabinet meeting, Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said a negative PCR certificate would only be required if the returning resident or visitor is not fully vaccinated. Anyone entering the country must present proof of vaccination with a WHO-approved vaccine, Mutsvangwa said. Zimbabwe's COVID-19 cases have significantly decreased over the past month, prompting the government to lift some restrictions.  ■
