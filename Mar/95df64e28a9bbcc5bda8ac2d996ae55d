RABAT, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Moroccan Navy Coast Guard seized on Friday two tonnes of cannabis off coast of northern city of Al Hoceima, Moroccan radio quoted a military source as saying. The banned substance was packed in 53 bundles on a go-fast boat heading to Spain, where the smugglers on board abandoned the drugs, fleeing at a high speed when approached by units of Moroccan coast guard, it added. The cannabis recovered from the sea were transported to the port of Al Hoceima, and handed over to the Royal Gendarmerie, it said. Despite efforts to crack down on cannabis during the past decade, Morocco remains one of the world's largest producers of the narcotic plant, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.  ■
