JUBA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- At least five civilians have been killed in Abara Boma, Magwi County in South Sudan's Eastern Equatoria following clashes between cattle herders and host community on Wednesday, a local government official said Thursday. Louis Lobong Lojore, Eastern Equatoria governor said Abara Boma in Magwi County was attacked by the cattle herders from Jonglei state on Wednesday evening. "Five people were killed, houses were burnt and a number of cattle stolen," Lobong said in a statement issued in Torit, the capital of Eastern Equatoria, located South of the country. This comes after the cattle keepers' camp was attacked by raiders in Agoro, Magwi County on Feb. 27, leaving 20 people dead and more than 15 others injured. The official called on the national authorities in Juba to intervene and contain the situation from further escalation. Since 2019, South Sudan has been experiencing a surge in communal violence in Jonglei, Warrap and Lakes states mainly due to cattle rustling, child abduction and revenge killings.  ■
