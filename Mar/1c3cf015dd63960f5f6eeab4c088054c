MADRID, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of Spain will roll out tax reliefs to alleviate the economic impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has said. In an interview with local TV channel La Sexta late on Monday, Sanchez said the price of natural gas, fuel, electricity as well as wheat and sunflower oil has spiked in recent weeks and has had a knock-on effect on the country's whole economy. In February, Spain's inflation rate reached a 35-year high of 7.6 percent driven mainly by energy costs. Also on Monday, the country's transport workers began an indefinite nationwide strike against high fuel prices. Sanchez said that the tax cuts -- part of a "national plan" -- will be approved at a cabinet meeting scheduled for March 29. Sanchez criticized the way energy costs are calculated in the European Union (EU), arguing that the current system in which the price of gas has a big influence on electricity prices "made no sense." He said Spain produces the bulk of its electricity from renewable sources, with only 15 percent of it generated from gas. The system currently used in the EU is "badly designed," he said, adding that several EU member states "of all political shades agree with Spain's proposal" to change it.  ■
