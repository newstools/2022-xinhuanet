JAKARTA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Timor Leste has coordinated with its closest neighbor Indonesia to tighten security in its borders to prevent any illegal crossing ahead of a presidential election. "There are four cross-border posts and four traditional posts that are prone to individuals illegally crossing the borders. Our immigration authorities are ready to increase monitoring to any foreigners who are about to enter Timor Leste from Indonesia," Jesuino Dos Reis Matos de Carvalho, Timor Leste's Consul in Kupang in Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province, said on Friday. Timor Leste, the half-island nation of 1.3 million people, will hold its fifth presidential election on March 19, with 16 candidates competing to become the country's next state leader, including incumbent President Francisco Guterres, former president and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Jose Ramos-Horta, and former Catholic priest Martinho Germano da Silva Gusmao. Local media reported that around 860,000 voters had been registered to cast their ballots to choose the president of the Southeast Asian country. Jesuino also said that to ensure that the election would run smoothly, he already asked help from the Indonesian police and military to secure the border areas. Separately, Indonesian Ambassador to Timor Leste, Okto Dorinus Manik, said that there would be a surge in the number of people crossing the Indonesia-Timor Leste borders ahead of the election. "The number will include the Timor Leste nationals who return to the country for the polls," Manik said.  ■
