(Tunisian Presidency/Handout via Xinhua) TUNIS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Members of Tunisian caretaker Superior Council of the Judiciary took oath on Monday with the presence of President Kais Saied who ordered the reshuffle three weeks earlier. Presiding at the oath-taking ceremony, Saied said Tunisia "is working to restore the independence of justice." On Feb. 13, Saied signed a presidential decree to form the interim council to replace the one he dissolved a week earlier over suspected corruption by many local magistrates. "A war has been triggered in Tunisia against corruption, but especially against the desperate attempts to destroy the state and divide it into sub-entities of power," he said at the ceremony. The interim council, including at least 10 women, comprises three departments respectively taking care of judicial, administrative and financial affairs. ■   Tunisian President Kais Saied (R, Front) speaks to members of the caretaker Superior Council of the Judiciary in Tunis, Tunisia, on March 7, 2022.
