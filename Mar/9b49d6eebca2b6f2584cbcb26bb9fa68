BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Worker shortage in the United States is far from over, CNN reported Wednesday, citing new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In January, there were not enough workers to fill 11.3 million jobs across the country, according to the report. "Despite the high level of available positions, job openings fell in several industries as infections from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus weighed on some businesses," the report said. "Professional and business services, education and transport and warehousing counted the most available job openings," it added.  ■
