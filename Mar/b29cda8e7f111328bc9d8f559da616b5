KHARTOUM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior security official from South Sudan on Sunday called for talks between Sudan's political parties and national forces in order to reach a consensus for the country's stability. During his meeting with Chairman of Sudan's Transitional Sovereign Council Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, Tut Gatluak, South Sudan's presidential adviser on security affairs, said Sudan's security and stability is conducive to stability and security in South Sudan as well as in the region, according to a statement issued by Sudan's Transitional Sovereign Council. "The meeting reviewed the current political situation in Sudan, as well as the efforts of the Sudanese government, the United Nations and the African Union to find a way out of the current situation in Sudan," Gatluak was quoted as saying. Gatluak delivered a written message from South Sudan's President Salva Kiir Mayardit to Al-Burhan. Sudan has been suffering a political crisis after General Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan declared a state of emergency on Oct. 25, 2021 and dissolved the Sovereign Council and the government. Since then, the Sudanese capital of Khartoum and other cities have been witnessing continued protests demanding a return to civilian rule.  ■
