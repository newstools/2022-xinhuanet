ULAN BATOR, March 28 (Xinhua) -- At least 120 million trees will be planted here by 2030, the Mongolian capital's mayor announced on Monday. "We are planning to plant at least 120 million trees in the capital city by 2030 within the framework of the 'Billion Trees' national tree-planting campaign initiated by Mongolian President Ukhnaa Khurelsukh," mayor Dolgorsuren Sumiyabazar said at a meeting. The nationwide tree-planting campaign was officially launched last year as president Khurelsukh told the United Nations General Assembly that the country aims to combat climate change and desertification through the campaign. Forest only covers 7.9 percent of Mongolia's 1,564,116 square km of land currently. Around 77 percent of the country's total territory has been affected by desertification and land degradation, according to the country's Ministry of Environment and Tourism.  ■
