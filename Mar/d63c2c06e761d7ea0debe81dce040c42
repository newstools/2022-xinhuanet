DUBLIN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Online retail sales in Ireland have dropped sharply following the removal of COVID-19 restrictions on local businesses, according to the figures released by the country's Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Monday. In January 2022, only 5.8 percent of retail sales in Ireland were transacted online compared to 9.7 percent in December 2021, and an all-time high of 15.3 percent in April 2020 following the first lockdown in the country on March 27, 2020. In March 2020, online retail sales accounted for 4.5 percent of all retail sales in Ireland, a figure slightly higher than the 4.1 percent recorded in the pre-pandemic December 2019. There were similar but less dramatic increases in the share of online sales in subsequent lockdowns, said the CSO. Ireland was placed under another two national lockdowns in October and December of 2020. Following the October lockdown, the share of online sales jumped from six percent in October to 12.4 percent in November. After the December lockdown, the share jumped from 5.8 percent in December to 11 percent in January 2021. Starting from the end of this February, the Irish government has scrapped the rules requiring people to wear masks in indoor retail settings. The move will help physical stores attract more customers and may result in a further decline in online retail sales, according to local watchers.  ■
