NEW YORK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Few Americans believe there has been significant progress over the last 50 years in achieving equal treatment for black people in dealings with police and the criminal justice system, the Associate Press has reported. In a new poll jointly conducted with NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, the news agency found that black Americans, many of whom held hope in Democrats' promises on racial justice initiatives in 2020, are especially pessimistic about future progress in this regard. An overwhelming majority of American adults across racial and ethnic groups say more progress is needed for racial equality, with about half of them saying "a lot" more progress is needed, according to the poll.  ■
