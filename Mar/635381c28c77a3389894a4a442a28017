PHNOM PENH, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's anti-drug police have arrested an American national and his Cambodian accomplice for allegedly trafficking almost 43 kg of drug, the National Police reported on Saturday. The duo, a 33-year-old U.S. man and a 29-year-old Cambodian man, were caught on March 6 at two locations in capital Phnom Penh. "A total of 42.7 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine (ice) was confiscated from them during the raids," the National Police said on its website.
