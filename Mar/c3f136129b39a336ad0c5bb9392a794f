HARARE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe aims to vaccinate 70 percent of its population against COVID-19 by the end of July, after launching a vaccination blitz this week to ramp up the process. Up to 35 percent of the population has so far received two doses of the vaccine since the country began its inoculation program in February last year. Addressing a post-cabinet media briefing on Tuesday, Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said the nation had enough vaccines to cover the eligible population. "The main aim of the campaign is to reach 70 percent of the total population by end of July 2022 in line with WHO regulations," she said. Mutsvangwa said out of the 22,405,000 vaccine doses procured by the country, 8,034,932 had so far been administered. The vaccination blitz launched this week, after a slow down in vaccine uptake, will run up to May this year targeting children aged 12 and above. As of Monday, Zimbabwe had recorded 244,685 COVID-19 cases with 234,895 recoveries and 5,429 deaths.   ■
