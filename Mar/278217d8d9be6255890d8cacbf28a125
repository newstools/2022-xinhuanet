KAMPALA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan legislators on Friday voted a new parliamentary speaker following the death of the office bearer Jacob Oulanyah. Anita Among was elected as the 11th House Speaker after competing with opposition candidate Asuman Basalirwa. Among, a member of the ruling National Resistance Movement, will be the country's second female speaker. Oulanyah died on Sunday at a hospital in the United States. In her acceptance speech, Among said she would carry Oulanyah's mantle forward. "By the Grace of God, we shall do our bit to create a better country for all in honor of the legacy of our leader and brother Jacob Oulanyah," she said.  ■
