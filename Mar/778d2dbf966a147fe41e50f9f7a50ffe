NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Balram Bhargava said on Thursday that unvaccinated people account for 92 percent of COVID-19 deaths so far this year in India. "During 2022, unvaccinated individuals were 92 percent responsible for all the deaths," he told a press briefing. Quoting a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing mortality, Bhargava said the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine is 98.9 percent effective and if both doses are given, the effectiveness is 99.3 percent. V.K. Paul, member of think-tank National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog (commission), said vaccines have played a vital role in the fight against COVID-19. "It is evident that vaccines and the wide vaccination coverage have played a very important role in protecting hundreds of lives. The vaccine has protected the nation from a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases," he said. According to officials, COVID-19 deaths have seen a sharp fall in India. "On an average 10,787 daily deaths were reported around the world during Feb. 2-8 which have now declined to 8,300 daily deaths from Feb. 23 to March 1, 2022," senior health ministry official Lav Agarwal told the media. "India reported a sharper decline in deaths reported (76.6 percent) as compared to the world (22.8 percent)." The ongoing third wave of COVID-19 in India has gone sluggish as the daily caseload of new infections is showing a downward spiral. The Indian health ministry said Thursday morning that 6,561 new cases and 142 COVID-19 related deaths were reported from across the South Asian country during the past 24 hours.  ■
