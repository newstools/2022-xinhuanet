COLOMBO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan State Ministry of Production, Supply and Regulation of Pharmaceuticals has agreed to revise the control price of imported medicines in proportion to the change in U.S. dollar, said an official here Thursday. State Minister Channa Jayasumana told the media that gazette notifications will be issued announcing the revised prices. A number of commonly used medicines in Sri Lanka are currently sold under controlled pricing, which include a number of medicines that are imported. Jayasumana said that the state ministry plans to introduce a system to help change the imported medicine prices according to the fluctuation of the Sri Lankan rupee. The central bank of Sri Lanka on Monday allowed the rupee to devalue to 230 per U.S. dollar considering the severity of the external shocks and recent developments in the domestic front. The Sri Lankan government made the last price revision on medicines when a U.S. dollar was exchanged at 194 rupees.  ■
