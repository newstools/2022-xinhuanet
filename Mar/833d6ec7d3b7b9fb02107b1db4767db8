COPENHAGEN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Denmark and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) signed an extradition agreement on Thursday, paving the way for suspected perpetrators of crimes relating to Denmark to be extradited and prosecuted. The agreement aims to expedite "two specific criminal cases," said a press release issued by the Ministry of Justice. The Danish authorities are seeking the extradition of suspected perpetrators in a high-profile dividend tax case along with a motorist accused of the hit-and-run killing of a police officer in Copenhagen in 2019. According to the Ministry of Justice, the new agreement, which comes after two years of negotiations, will also promote mutual legal assistance between Denmark and the UAE in criminal cases. Denmark now joins other European Union (EU) countries, such as the Netherlands and Belgium, that have recently concluded similar agreements with the UAE.  ■
