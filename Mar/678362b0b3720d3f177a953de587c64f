ULAN BATOR, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia will impose a one-year ban on collecting deer antlers, the country's Ministry of Environment and Tourism said Tuesday. "In order to prevent ecological imbalance and damage to forest resources due to forest and grassland fires, citizens and legal entities have been prohibited from collecting and preparing deer antlers for a period of one year," the ministry said in a statement. A total of 65 wildfires were reported across Mongolia in 2021, causing 3.1 billion Mongolian Tugriks (over 1 million U.S. dollars) in environmental damage, the ministry said. One of the main causes of wildfires was human error, the ministry said, noting that many people who went to forests to collect cedar nuts and deer antler threw cigarette butts which caused fires.  ■
