MADRID, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The government of Spain and the country's National Road Transport Committee (CNTC) concluded an agreement on Friday to give financial aid to transport workers to end a strike that has lasted for 12 days and caused severe damage to the economy. Under the agreement, the price of a liter of fuel will be reduced by 20 eurocents until June 30, although this could be extended if the effects of the conflict in Ukraine continue to force fuel prices up. The price reduction will be borne partly by the government (15 eurocents) and by the fuel companies. The measure will enter into force after a scheduled March 29 cabinet meeting, when Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez aims to pass a range of measures to help deal with rising energy costs. According to the government, the framework agreement is worth over one billion euros (1.1 billion U.S. dollars), of which 600 million euros will be used to subsidize fuel and 450 billion euros as direct aid to the freight and passenger transport sectors. The agreement is expected to bring an end to the conflict that has emptied supermarket shelves and left dairy producers with no option other than to pour their milk down the drain as it was not being collected. The shortage of materials supplies caused by the strike forced several factories, among them those of Mercedes and Volkswagen in Vitoria and Navarra, respectively, to halt production. However, the Platform for the Defense of the Road Transport Sector, which represents around 20 percent of Spain's truck drivers but is not affiliated with the country's larger national trucking associations, has so far refused to accept the agreement.  ■
