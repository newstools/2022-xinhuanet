NEW DELHI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday said India is emerging as a global leader in sectors that were previously considered out of reach, such as mobile phone manufacturing. "India has become the second largest mobile manufacturer in the world," Modi said. "Seven years ago there were only two mobile manufacturing companies in India. Today more than 200 manufacturing units are engaged in this work." Modi made the comments in his address to the inaugural Golden Jubilee celebration of Symbiosis University in Pune. Modi said at present India is innovating, improving and influencing the whole world. "Your generation is fortunate in a way that it has not suffered the damaging impact of the earlier defensive and dependent psychology. Credit for this goes to all of you, goes to our youth," Modi said. He called upon the students to take full advantage of the opening of various sectors, particularly the recent reforms in geospatial systems, drones, semi-conductors and space technology.  ■
