COLOMBO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Department of Census and Statistics announced Monday that the overall rate of inflation for February 2022, as measured by National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) on year-on-year basis, stood at 17.5 percent. This is the highest since 2015, when the NCPI was first released. The NCPI has weights based on consumer spending in the 2012/13 Household Income and Expenditure Survey and reflects new methods consistent with the best international practices. Inflation calculated for January 2022 was 16.8 percent. The higher inflation for the month of February 2022 was mainly due to the higher price levels in both food and non-food categories. The year-on-year inflation of the food category increased to 24.7 percent in February 2022 from 24.4 percent in January 2022, and that of  the non-food group rose to 11 percent in February 2022 from 10.2 percent in the previous month.  ■
