NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Delegations of India and Pakistan discussed issues under the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) during a meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), said the Indian Foreign Ministry. The three-day meeting, which concluded on Thursday, was held in Pakistan's Islamabad, during which "technical discussions were held regarding on-going projects including Pakal Dul, Kiru and Lower Kalnai," according to a statement issued by the ministry. The PIC, comprising of Indus commissioners of India and Pakistan, discussed "the exchange of hydrological and flood data," the statement said. "Both the commissioners reaffirmed their commitment to interact more frequently in an attempt to resolve issues through bilateral discussions under the treaty," it added. The PIC also agreed to hold the next meeting "in New Delhi on mutually convenient dates," it said. Post-partition of the subcontinent water-sharing was a major problem between India and Pakistan. The issue was resolved with the arbitration of the World Bank and a settlement in the name of IWT was reached in 1960. The agreement governs how the two countries use and share water resources. Under the provisions of the IWT, the two commissioners are required to meet at least once every year, alternately in India and Pakistan.  ■
