CHICAGO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell on Friday as the U.S. dollar strengthened. The most active gold contract for April delivery fell 13.9 U.S. dollars, or 0.72 percent, to close at 1,929.3 dollars per ounce. Dollar has strengthened as the United States and UK have kicked off a new regime of higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve took the lead on Wednesday in raising benchmark rates by a quarter percentage point to between 0.25 percent and 0.5 percent and laying out plans for ongoing increases in the policy rate. Market analysts expect a choppy short-term road ahead, with the 1,900-dollar level providing key support. In the next step, the development of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Federal Reserve's next decisions will be the main market drivers for gold price. Gold dropped about 2.8 percent in the week, the largest weekly decline since November of last year. Silver for May delivery fell 52.9 cents, or 2.07 percent, to close at 25.087 dollars per ounce. Platinum for April delivery rose 4.6 dollars, or 0.45 percent, to close at 1,035.9 dollars per ounce.  ■
