WINDHOEK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Namibia has called for the fast elimination of violence and harassment against women at the workplace, as the country joined the rest of the world in celebrating International Women's Day Tuesday. "There is no doubt that this year's campaign, -- The Time is now! To fight against violence and harassment at the workplace -- particularly resonates with all of us as it is geared toward the transformative agenda of empowering women in the society," said Namibia's Deputy Labor Commissioner Kyllikki Sihlahla Tuesday in her key statement at an event held in Windhoek, the Namibian capital. Sihlahla said women play a significant role in society, however, their role has been downplayed by male dominance in all domains of society since time immemorial. "As women, we should not let society project its fears unto us. Women should take up space in society, as there is great importance in cementing yourself in society," she said, noting that in the recent past, a number of violence and harassment cases involving or targeted toward women have been witnessed at workplaces. According to Sihlahla, the challenges women face in the workplace are real and some women even suffer from severe depression, which if not addressed on time can result in constructive dismissal. "Therefore, there is a need to actively advocate for psychological safety in all organizations. We should use Convention 190 at our disposal to eliminate violence and harassment at the workplace," she added. Namibia became the first African country and the only third International Labour Organization member state to ratify Convention 190, which is aimed at protecting workers and other persons in the world of work.  ■
