BERLIN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's seven-day COVID-19 incidence rate has risen for the second day in a row, reaching 1,196 infections per 100,000 inhabitants, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases said on Friday. Daily infections also rose, with the RKI registering 217, 593 new COVID-19 infections within 24 hours on Friday. This was around 6,900 more than a week ago. However, German laboratories have also warned of significant under-reporting due to less testing. Among older people over the age of 65, infection numbers are likely to continue to increase due to the ongoing Omicron wave. "In this age group, the peak of the wave is still to come," the RKI said in its weekly report on Thursday. Nevertheless, Germany further relaxed its COVID-19 measures on Friday. Customers in restaurants and hotels are now only required to follow the so-called 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, tested), while clubs can re-open under the stricter 2G-Plus rule. This requires a negative test, in addition to vaccinated or recovered status. On Thursday, restrictions for entering Germany were eased, with travelers no longer obliged to register electronically upon arrival. In addition, the 3G rule now only applies to children from the age of 12 instead of six.  ■
