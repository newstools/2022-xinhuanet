WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy has expanded at a modest to moderate pace since mid-January amid high inflation pressures, as firms expect additional price increases over the next several months, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. "Prices charged to customers increased at a robust pace across the nation," the Fed said in its latest survey on economic conditions, known as the Beige Book, based on information collected from its 12 regional reserve banks. "Rising input costs were cited as a primary contributing factor across a broad swath of industries, with elevated transport costs particularly significant," the Fed said, adding labor cost increases and ongoing materials shortages also contributed to higher input prices. Meanwhile, U.S. firms reported an increased ability to pass on prices to consumers as demand has remained strong in most cases, according to the survey. "Firms reported they expect additional price increases over the next several months as they continue to pass on input cost increases," the survey said. The survey also showed that the surge in COVID-19 cases had temporarily disrupted business activity and consumer spending was "generally weaker" than in the prior report. The survey came after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier Wednesday that he is inclined to support a 25-basis-point rate hike at the central bank's upcoming policy meeting later this month. "Inflation increased sharply last year and is now running well above our longer-run objective of 2 percent," Powell said in his prepared remarks at a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee. The consumer price index in January rose 7.5 percent from a year earlier, the fastest annual pace in almost 40 years, according to the U.S. Labor Department.  ■
