MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin said Friday that Washington must explain the involvement of U.S. President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden in the financing of Ukrainian biological laboratories. The investment fund Rosemont Seneca, currently managed by Hunter Biden, financed the Pentagon's military biological program in Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry said Thursday. "This is very sensitive information both for us and for the whole world," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a daily briefing. He said that Washington was attempting to deflect attention from U.S. biological programs by discussing the alleged threat of Russia using chemical weapons in Ukraine. During a special military operation in Ukraine, the Russian military has found that U.S.-funded biological laboratories conducted research with dangerous viruses, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. The Russian side has repeatedly urged Washington to explain the purpose of these facilities to the international community.  ■
