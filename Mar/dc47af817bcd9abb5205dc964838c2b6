COLOMBO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Monday declared open the largest cement factory in the country, located in Hambantota's Mirijjawila Export Processing Zone. The facility, located on a 63-acre plot, can produce 4 million metric tons of cement a year. Lanwa Sanstha Cement Corporation (Pvt) Ltd. which owns the plant, said that the "facility features a fully automated stacker reclaimer yard and two bridge type ship unloaders for efficient, waste-free and sustainable handling of cargo." The company believes that this would be a great boon to the country's construction industry that had been facing chronic shortages of cement. The factory is to produce the full range of cement products and would cater to an increasing local demand for cement for projects including the Port City and the network of expressways.  ■
