TRIPOLI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Libyan House of Representatives, or parliament, on Tuesday granted confidence to a new government to replace the current Government of National Unity led by Prime Minister Abdul-Hamid Dbeibah. "The House of Representatives unanimously granted confidence to the new government, with a majority of 92 votes," the parliament spokesperson Abdullah Blehig said in a statement. The 101-seat Libyan parliament withdrew confidence from Dbeibah's government in September last year and kept it as a caretaker government. On Feb. 10, it unanimously voted to appoint Fathi Bashagha, former interior minister, as the new prime minister. But Dbeibah vowed his government will remain in office until an elected government is established. On Feb. 21, he announced a plan to hold general elections in June. General elections in Libya had been scheduled for Dec. 24 last year, but were postponed indefinitely due to technical and legal issues, according to the country's elections commission.  ■
